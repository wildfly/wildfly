transactions=The configuration of the transaction subsystem.
transactions.add=Adds the transaction subsystem
transactions.remove=Removes the transaction subsystem

transactions.configuration=various environment configuration. It could refer to core, recovery, coordinator environment and to object store configs.

transactions.node-identifier=Used to set the node identifier on the core environment.
transactions.process-id-uuid=Indicates whether the transaction manager should use a UUID based process id.
transactions.process-id-socket-binding=The name of the socket binding configuration to use if the transaction manager should use a socket-based process id. Will be 'undefined' if 'process-id-uuid' is 'true'; otherwise must be set.
transactions.process-id-socket-max-ports=The maximum number of ports to search for an open port if the transaction manager should use a socket-based process id. If the port specified by the socket binding referenced in 'process-id-socket-binding' is occupied, the next higher port will be tried until an open port is found or the number of ports specified by this attribute have been tried. Will be 'undefined' if 'process-id-uuid' is 'true'.
transactions.path=Denotes a relative or absolute filesystem path denoting where the transaction manager core should store data. By default the value is treated as relative to the path denoted by the "relative-to" attribute.
transactions.relative-to=References a global path configuration in the domain model, defaulting to the JBoss Application Server data directory (jboss.server.data.dir). The value of the "path" attribute will treated as relative to this path. Use an empty string to disable the default behavior and force the value of the "path" attribute to be treated as an absolute path.
transactions.jts=If true this enables the Java Transaction Service
transactions.use-hornetq-store=Use the HornetQ journal store for writing transaction logs. Set to true to enable and to false to use the default log store type. The default log store is normally one file system file per transaction log. The server should be restarted for this setting to take effect.

transactions.socket-binding=Used to reference the correct socket binding to use for the recovery environment.
transactions.status-socket-binding=Used to reference the correct socket binding to use for the transaction status manager.
transactions.recovery-listener=Used to specify if the recovery system should listen on a network socket or not.

transactions.enable-statistics=Whether statistics should be enabled.
transactions.enable-tsm-status=Whether the transaction status manager (TSM) service, needed for out of process recovery, should be provided or not..
transactions.default-timeout=The default timeout.

transactions.object-store-path=Denotes a relative or absolute filesystem path denoting where the transaction manager object store should store data. By default the value is treated as relative to the path denoted by the "relative-to" attribute.
transactions.object-store-relative-to=References a global path configuration in the domain model, defaulting to the JBoss Application Server data directory (jboss.server.data.dir). The value of the "path" attribute will treated as relative to this path. Use an empty string to disable the default behavior and force the value of the "path" attribute to be treated as an absolute path.

transactions.number-of-transactions=The total number of transactions (top-level and nested) created
transactions.number-of-nested-transactions=The total number of nested (sub) transactions created.
transactions.number-of-heuristics=The number of transactions which have terminated with heuristic outcomes.
transactions.number-of-committed-transactions=The number of committed transactions.
transactions.number-of-aborted-transactions=The number of aborted (i.e. rolledback) transactions.
transactions.number-of-inflight-transactions=The number of transactions that have begun but not yet terminated.
transactions.number-of-timed-out-transactions=The number of transactions that have rolled back due to timeout.
transactions.number-of-application-rollbacks=The number of transactions that have been rolled back by application request. This includes those that timeout, since the timeout behavior is considered an attribute of the application configuration.
transactions.number-of-resource-rollbacks=The number of transactions that rolled back due to resource (participant) failure.

transactions.log-store.transaction.delete=Remove this transaction log. WARNING after this operation the transaction manager will have no knowledge of the transaction and will therefore never be able to recover it. If you are sure that the transaction is complete then the operation is safe. The representation of the transaction log is removed from the model too.
transactions.log-store.transaction.participant.refresh=Refresh the management view of the attributes of this participant record by querying the transaction log. (Note that the read-resource operaton only reads the model, hence the need for this refresh operation).
transactions.log-store.transaction.participant.recover=If this record is in a heuristic state then attempt to replay the commit phase of the 2PC transaction.

transactions.log-store=Representation of the transaction logging storage mechanism.
transactions.log-store.add=Add a representation of the transaction logging storage mechanism.
transactions.log-store.probe=Scan for new transaction logs. This operation will creates a child for each pending transaction.
transactions.log-store.remove=Remove a representation of the transaction logging storage mechanism.
transactions.log-store.type=Specifies the implementation type of the logging store.
transactions.log-store.transactions=The persistent information that the transaction manager stores for the purpose of recovering a transaction in the event of failure. The probe operation will add and remove transactions from the model as the corresponding real transactions start and finish the prepare and commit phases. A stuck transaction will remain in the model until either it is completed or explicitly removed by the delete operation.
transactions.log-store.transaction=The persistent information that the transaction manager stores for the purpose of recovering a transaction in the event of failure. The probe operation will add and remove transactions from the model as the corresponding real transactions start and finish the prepare and commit phases. A stuck transaction will remain in the model until either it is completed or explicitly removed by the delete operation.
transactions.log-store.transaction.add=Add a transaction to log-store.
transactions.log-store.transaction.jmx-name=The JMX name of this transaction.
transactions.log-store.transaction.id=The id of this transaction.
transactions.log-store.transaction.age-in-seconds=The time since this transaction was prepared or when the recovery system last tried to recover it.
transactions.log-store.transaction.type=The type name under which this record is stored.
transactions.log-store.transaction.participants=The resources that did work in a transaction.
transactions.log-store.transaction.participant=The resources that did work in a transaction.
transactions.log-store.transaction.participant.jmx-name=The JMX name of this participant.
transactions.log-store.transaction.participant.add=Add a transaction participant to a transaction log.
transactions.log-store.transaction.participant.status=Reports the commitment status of this participant (can be one of Pending, Prepared, Failed, Heuristic or Readonly).
transactions.log-store.transaction.participant.jndi-name=JNDI name of this participant.
transactions.log-store.transaction.participant.type=The type name under which this record is stored.
transactions.log-store.transaction.participant.eis-product-name=The JCA enterprise information system's product name.
transactions.log-store.transaction.participant.eis-product-version=The JCA enterprise information system's product version
