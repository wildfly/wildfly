jaxrs.deployment.show-resources=List all JAXRS resources of deployment.
jaxrs.deployment.show-resources.jaxrs-resource=Jakarta RESTful Web Services Resource for the current deployment.
jaxrs.deployment.show-resources.deprecated=The show-resources() operation is deprecated, use read-resource() instead.

jaxrs.deployment.rest-resource=REST Resources of the deployment.
jaxrs.deployment.resource-class=Class for the Jakarta RESTful Web Services resource.
jaxrs.deployment.rest-resource-paths=REST resource paths of the Jakarta RESTful Web Services resource.
jaxrs.deployment.rest-resource-paths.resource-class=Class for the Jakarta RESTful Web Services resource.
jaxrs.deployment.rest-resource-paths.resource-path=Path of the Jakarta RESTful Web Services resource.
jaxrs.deployment.rest-resource-paths.consumes=Consume types of the Jakarta RESTful Web Services resource.
jaxrs.deployment.rest-resource-paths.produces=Produce types of the Jakarta RESTful Web Services resource.
jaxrs.deployment.rest-resource-paths.java-method=Java method of the Jakarta RESTful Web Services resource.
jaxrs.deployment.rest-resource-paths.resource-methods=Annotated methods for the Jakarta RESTful Web Services resource.

jaxrs.deployment.sub-resource-locators=REST resource paths of the Jakarta RESTful Web Services resource.
jaxrs.deployment.sub-resource-locators.resource-class=Class for the Jakarta RESTful Web Services resource.
jaxrs.deployment.sub-resource-locators.resource-path=Path of the Jakarta RESTful Web Services resource.
jaxrs.deployment.sub-resource-locators.consumes=Consume types of the Jakarta RESTful Web Services resource.
jaxrs.deployment.sub-resource-locators.produces=Produce types of the Jakarta RESTful Web Services resource.
jaxrs.deployment.sub-resource-locators.java-method=Java method of the Jakarta RESTful Web Services resource.
jaxrs.deployment.sub-resource-locators.resource-methods=Annotated methods for the Jakarta RESTful Web Services resource.

jaxrs.jaxrs-2-0-request-matching=In searching for a matching resource method with which to respond to a request, consider only resource methods with the best match for the request path.
jaxrs.resteasy-add-charset=If a resource method returns a text/* or application/xml* media type without an explicit charset, RESTEasy will add "charset=UTF-8" to the returned Content-Type header. Note that the charset defaults to UTF-8 in this case, independent of the setting of this parameter.
jaxrs.resteasy-buffer-exception-entity=Upon receiving an exception, the client side buffers any response entity before closing the connection.
jaxrs.resteasy-disable-html-sanitizer=Normally, a response with media type "text/html" and a status of 400 will be processed so that the characters "/", "<", ">", "&", """ (double quote), and "'" (single quote) are escaped to prevent an XSS attack. Setting this parameter to "true", escaping will not occur.
jaxrs.resteasy-disable-providers=A comma delimited list of fully qualified provider class names that will be disabled.
jaxrs.resteasy-document-expand-entity-references=Expand external entities in org.w3c.dom.Document documents and Jakarta XML Binding object representations.
jaxrs.resteasy-document-expand-entity-references.deprecated=This JAXP feature does not behave the same in all JAXP \
  implementations and is therefore deprecated.
jaxrs.resteasy-document-secure-disableDTDs=Prohibit DTDs in org.w3c.dom.Document documents and Jakarta XML Binding object representations.
jaxrs.resteasy-document-secure-disableDTDs.deprecated=This JAXP feature does not behave the same in all JAXP \
  implementations and is therefore deprecated.
jaxrs.resteasy-document-secure-processing-feature=Impose security constraints in processing org.w3c.dom.Document documents and Jakarta XML Binding object representations.
jaxrs.resteasy-gzip-max-input=Imposes maximum size on decompressed gzipped.
jaxrs.resteasy-jndi-resources=A comma delimited list of JNDI names which reference objects to be registered as Jakarta RESTful Web Services resources.
jaxrs.resteasy-language-mappings=Replaces the need for an Accept-Language header by mapping file name extensions (like .en or .fr) to a language. Used when the client is unable to use an Accept-Language header to choose a language (i.e. a browser).
jaxrs.resteasy-media-type-mappings=Replaces the need for an Accept header by mapping file name extensions (like .xml or .txt) to a media type. Used when the client is unable to use an Accept header to choose a representation (i.e. a browser).
jaxrs.resteasy-media-type-param-mapping=Names a query parameter that can be set to an acceptable media type, enabling content negotiation without an Accept header.
jaxrs.resteasy-original-webapplicationexception-behavior=When set to true, this parameter will restore the original behavior in which a Client running in a resource method will throw a WebApplicationException instead of a RESTEeasy version with a sanitized Response.
jaxrs.resteasy-patchfilter-disabled=Specifies that JSON Patch and JSON Merge Patch functionalities are all disabled.
jaxrs.resteasy-prefer-jackson-over-jsonb=Specifies that the Jackson JSON provider should be preferred over the default Jakarta JSON Processing provider for JSON binding.
jaxrs.resteasy-providers=A comma delimited list of fully qualified @Provider class names you want to register.
jaxrs.resteasy-rfc7232preconditions=Enables RFC7232 compliant HTTP preconditions handling.
jaxrs.resteasy-role-based-security=Enables role based security.
jaxrs.resteasy-secure-random-max-use=The number of times a SecureRandom can be used before reseeding.
jaxrs.resteasy-use-builtin-providers=Whether or not to register default, built-in @Provider classes.
jaxrs.resteasy-use-container-form-params=HttpServletRequest.getParameterMap(). Use this switch if you are calling this method within a servlet filter or consuming the input stream within the filter.
jaxrs.resteasy-wider-request-matching=Turns off the Jakarta RESTful Web Services spec defined class-level expression filtering and instead tries to match every method's full path.
jaxrs.tracing-type="ALL" will enable the tracing feature. "ON_DEMAND" mode will give control to the client side: A \
  client can send a tracing request via HTTP header and get the tracing info back from response headers. "OFF" mode \
  will disable the tracing feature, and this is the default mode. Note that it is suggested this is set to "OFF" \
  for production servers.
jaxrs.tracing-threshold=The "SUMMARY" threshold will emit some brief tracing information. The "TRACE" threshold will \
  produce more detailed tracing information, and the "VERBOSE" threshold will generate extremely detailed tracing \
  information.
