# Domain root
domain=The root node of the domain-level management model.

domain.socket-binding-group=A list of socket binding groups available for use in the domain
domain.system-properties=A list of system properties to set on all servers in the domain.
domain.system-property=A system property to set on all servers in the domain.
domain.deployment=A list of deployments available for use in the domain
domain.server-group=A list of server groups available for use in the domain
domain.host=Host controllers currently running in the domain
domain.process-type=The type of process represented by this root resource. Either "Domain Controller" or "Host Controller".
domain.release-version=The version of the JBoss Application Server release that is being run by the host controller that is acting as the domain controller.
domain.release-codename=The codename of the JBoss Application Server release that is being run by the host controller that is acting as the domain controller.
domain.product-name=The name of the JBoss AS based product that is being run by the host controller that is acting as the domain controller.
domain.product-version=The version of the JBoss AS based product release that is being run by the host controller that is acting as the domain controller.
domain.management-major-version=The major version of the JBoss AS management interface that is provided by the host controller that is acting as the domain controller.
domain.management-minor-version=The minor version of the JBoss AS management interface that is provided by the host controller that is acting as the domain controller.
domain.deployment.remove=Remove a deployment from the list of content available for use across the domain. The deployment cannot be currently mapped to any server groups.

domain.servers.restart=Restarts all servers currently running in the domain.
domain.servers.start=Starts all configured servers in the domain that are not currently running.
domain.servers.stop=Stops all servers currently running in the domain.


server-group=The server group configuration.
server-group.add=Add a new server group.
server-group.add.jvm=The jvm name.
server-group.remove=Remove an existing new server group.
server-group.profile=The profile name.
server-group.jvm=The named jvm.
server-group.socket-binding-group=The default socket binding group used for servers associated with this group.
server-group.socket-binding-port-offset=The default offset to be added to the port values given by the socket binding group.
server-group.management-subsystem-endpoint=Set to true to have servers belonging to the server group connect back to the host controller using the endpoint from their remoting subsystem. The subsystem must be present for this to work.
server-group.deployment=A list of deployments available for use in the server group.
server-group.system-properties=A list of system properties to set on all servers in this server-group.
server-group.system-property=A system property to set on all servers in this server-group.

server-group.deployment.remove=Remove a deployment from the list of content available for use on servers in the group. If the deployment is currently deployed in the runtime it will first be undeployed.

server-group.servers.restart=Restarts all servers belonging to the server group currently running in the domain.
server-group.servers.start=Starts all configured servers belonging to the server group in the domain that are not currently running.
server-group.servers.stop=Stops all servers belonging to the server group currently running in the domain.

rollout-plans=Storage information about a set of named management update rollout plans useful to management clients that are stored in the domain content repository. The child resources under this resource provide access to these plans to management clients, allowing clients to use the plans by referencing them by name, avoiding the need to recreate them for each use.
rollout-plans.hash=The hash of all stored rollout plans. Used internally by host controllers to locate rollout plan content.
rollout-plans.add=Adds the capability to store named rollout plans.
rollout-plans.remove=Removes the capability to store named rollout plans.
rollout-plan=A stored rollout plan.
rollout-plan.hash=The hash of the rollout plan content.
rollout-plan.content=The rollout plan content, in JBoss DMR form.
rollout-plan.add=Adds a rollout plan to the persistent store.
rollout-plan.remove=Removes a rollout plan from the persistent store.
rollout-plan.store=Updates the content of an existing persisted rollout plan, after first checking that the provided 'hash' parameter matches the current rollout plan hash. Fails if the hashes do not match. Using this operation instead of the 'write-attribute' operation for the 'content' attribute provides a guarantee that the update will not conflict with a previous update unknown to the caller.
rollout-plan.store.hash=The value the caller believes to be the hash of the rollout plan content that is being replaced.
rollout-plan.store.content=The updated rollout plan content, in JBoss DMR form.

# Misc
domain.resolve-expression-on-domain=Operation that accepts an expression as input (or a string that can be parsed into an expression) and resolves it against the local system properties and environment variables on all servers in the domain.
domain.resolve-expression-on-domain.expression=The expression to resolve.
domain.resolve-expression-on-domain.reply=The resolved expression, or the string form of the original input value if it did not represent an expression.
