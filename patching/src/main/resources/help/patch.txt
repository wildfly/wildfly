	where <action> can be

    apply           - apply a patch
    history         - display the patching history
    info            - information about the active patches
    rollback        - rollback a patch that has been applied
    inspect         - fetch and print key information from the patch.xml
                      of the specified patch file

	and <action_arguments> depends on the <action>

ACTION: apply

    Apply a patch

    patch apply <file_path>
      [--override-all]
      [--override-modules]
      [--override=path(,path)*]
      [--preserve=path(,path)*]
      [--host=<host>]

    <file_path>          - the path to the patch to apply.
                           The path can be either absolute or relative to the
                           current directory.

ACTION: rollback

    Rollback a patch that has been applied

    patch rollback --patch-id=<id> --reset-configuration=(true|false)
      [--rollback-to]
      [--override-all]
      [--override-modules]
      [--override=path(,path)*]
      [--preserve=path(,path)*]
      [--host=<host>]

    --patch-id=<id>      - the ID of the patch to rollback

    --reset-configuration  - The argument is required for the rollback action
                             and expects a boolean value.
                           It signifies whether the rollback operation should
                           reset the installation configurations to their state
                           before the patch was applied.

    --rollback-to        - The argument does not expect any value and is
                           optional. The default is 'false'.
                           If the patch to rollback is a one-off patch, it
                           signifies that the rollback operation will also
                           rollback all the other one-off patches that have
                           been applied on top of the patch to rollback.

ACTION: info

    Information about the installed patches

    patch info
      [--host=<host>]

ACTION: history

    Patching history

    patch history
      [--host=<host>]

ACTION: inspect

    Fetches key information (patch id, patch type, target identity name
    and version, description) from the patch.xml of the specified patch file.

    patch inspect <file_path>

    <file_path>          - the path to the patch to inspect.
                           The path can be either absolute or relative to the
                           current directory.

DESCRIPTION

    Apply a patch to the server or rollback a patch that has been applied.

    This command does not required to be connected to the server.
    If it is connected, it will patch the server's installation.
    If it is not connected, it will patch the command-line interface's own
    installation.

    Applying and rolling back a patch will run consistency checks for all
    modified items. In case file conflicts are detected the operation will fail
    and the conflicting items will be part of the 'failure-description' grouped
    by type (bundles, modules, misc). In order to resolve the conflicts the
    operation has to be invoked again with additional arguments describing how
    the patch tool should deal with those conflicts.

ARGUMENTS:

 --host=<host>       - may appear only in the domain mode and is not allowed
                       in the standalone mode or if the cli is disconnected.
                       The argument expects the name of the host of the
                       installation to patch.

 --override          - The value is a comma-separated list of the miscellaneous
                       items in the patch that can be overridden on the server
                       whether the item reports a conflict or not.

 --preserve          - The value is a comma-separated list of the miscellaneous
                       items that must be preserved and not modified by
                       applying or rolling back a patch.

 --override-all      - The argument does not expect any value and is
                       optional. The default is 'false'.
                       It signifies to bypass any content verification on the
                       miscellaneous items changed by the patch.

 --override-modules -  The argument does not expect any value and is
                       optional. The default is 'false'.
                       It signifies to bypass any content verification on the
                       modules and OSGi bundles affected by the patch.
