      [--host=<host>]

	where <action> can be

    apply           - apply a patch
    info            - information about the installed patches
    rollback        - rollback a patch that has been applied

	and <action_arguments> depends on the <action>

ACTION: apply

    Apply a patch

    patch apply <file_path>
      [--override-all]
      [--override-modules]
      [--override=path(,path)*]
      [--preserve=path(,path)*]
      [--host=<host>]

    <file_path>          - the path to the patch to apply.
                           The path can be either absolute or relative to the
                           current directory.

ACTION: rollback

    Rollback a patch that has been applied

    NOTE: by default this operation will restore all *.xml files in the configuration directories
          to the state when the patch was applied.

    patch rollback --patch-id=<id>
      [--keep-configuration]
      [--rollback-to]
      [--override-all]
      [--override-modules]
      [--override=path(,path)*]
      [--preserve=path(,path)*]
      [--host=<host>]

    --patch-id=<id>      - the ID of the patch to rollback

    --keep-configuration - The argument does not expect any value and is
                           optional. The default is 'true'.
                           It signifies that the rollback operation will not
                           touch the installation configurations and will not
                           restore the snapshots that were taken when the patch
                           was applied.

    --rollback-to        - The argument does not expect any value and is
                           optional. The default is 'false'.
                           If the patch to rollback is a one-off patch, it
                           signifies that the rollback operation will also
                           rollback all the other one-off patches that have
                           been applied on top of the patch to rollback.

ACTION: info

    Information about the installed patches

DESCRIPTION

    Apply a patch to the server or rollback a patch that has been applied.

    This command does not required to be connected to the server.
    If it is connected, it will patch the server's installation.
    If it is not connected, it will patch the command-line interface's own
    installation.

    Applying and rolling back a patch will run consistency checks for all modified items.
    In case file conflicts are detected the operation will fail and the conflicting items
    will be part of the 'failure-description' grouped by type (bundles, modules, misc).
    In order to resolve the conflicts the operation has to be invoked again with additional
    arguments describing how the patch tool should deal with those conflicts.

ARGUMENTS:

 --host=<host>       - may appear only in the domain mode and is not allowed
                       in the standalone mode or if the cli is disconnected.
                       The argument expects the name of the host of the
                       installation to patch.

 --override          - The value is a comma-separated list of the miscellaneous
                       items in the patch that can be overridden on the server
                       whether the item reports a conflict or not.

 --preserve          - The value is a comma-separated list of the miscellaneous
                       items that must be preserved and not modified by
                       applying or rolling back a patch.

 --override-all      - The argument does not expect any value and is
                       optional. The default is 'false'.
                       It signifies to bypass any content verification on the
                       miscellaneous items changed by the patch.

 --override-modules -  The argument does not expect any value and is
                       optional. The default is 'false'.
                       It signifies to bypass any content verification on the
                       modules and OSGi bundles affected by the patch.
