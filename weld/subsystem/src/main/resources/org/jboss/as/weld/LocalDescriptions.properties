weld=The configuration of the weld subsystem.
weld.add=Operation creating the weld subsystem.
weld.remove=Operation removing the weld subsystem.
weld.require-bean-descriptor=If true then implicit bean archives without bean descriptor file (beans.xml) are ignored by Weld
weld.non-portable-mode=If true then the non-portable mode is enabled. The non-portable mode is suggested by the specification to overcome problems with legacy applications that do not use Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection SPI properly and may be rejected by more strict validation in CDI 1.1.
weld.development-mode=Weld comes with a special mode for application development. When the development mode is enabled, certain built-in tools, which facilitate the development of Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection applications, are available. Setting this attribute to true activates the development mode.
weld.thread-pool-size=The number of threads to be used by the Weld thread pool. The pool is shared across all Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection enabled deployments and used primarily for parallel Weld bootstrap.
