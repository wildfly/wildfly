jacorb.transactions=Indicates whether the transactions interceptors are to be installed (on or spec) or not (off). The value 'on' enabled JTS while 'spec' enables a spec compliant mode (non JTS) that rejects incoming transaction contexts.

# poa configuration properties.
jacorb.monitoring=Indicates whether the monitoring GUI should be displayed (on) or not (off).
jacorb.queue-wait=Indicates whether requests that exceed the maximum queue size should wait (on) or not (off). When disabled, a TRANSIENT exception is thrown if the queue is full.

jacorb.security-domain=The name of the security domain that holds the key and trust stores that will be used to establish SSL connections.
jacorb.add-component-via-interceptor=Indicates whether SSL components should be added by an IOR interceptor (on) or not (off).
jacorb.client-supports=Value that indicates the client SSL supported parameters (None, ServerAuth, ClientAuth, MutualAuth).
jacorb.client-requires=Value that indicates the client SSL required parameters (None, ServerAuth, ClientAuth, MutualAuth).
jacorb.server-supports=Value that indicates the server SSL supported parameters (None, ServerAuth, ClientAuth, MutualAuth).
jacorb.server-requires=Value that indicates the server SSL required parameters (None, ServerAuth, ClientAuth, MutualAuth).
