      Just here for the tests module to include as an optional dependency to avoid picking up
			the test-controller-xxx modules on the classpathi while making sure that the test-controller-xxx
			modules get compiled before the the test module. We only want the test-controller-xxx modules on
			the classpath when setting up the legacy controller classloaders, and want to be able to choose
			which one to use.
