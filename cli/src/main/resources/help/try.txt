SYNOPSIS

    try [--help]

DESCRIPTION

    Starts a try-catch-finally control flow.
    Each block, i.e. try, catch and finally, is executed as a separate batch.
    Which means if any of the commands or operation from the corresponding block
    fails then the whole block is rolled back.
    
    First try block is executed. The catch block, if present, is executed only
    if the try block fails. I.e. if the response of try comes with outcome
    "failed". If the was a java.io.IOException then the error is thrown
    immediately w/o executing catch or finally.
    The finally block, if present, is executed always.
    
    Unlike Java, there can only be one catch block.
    While both catch and finally blocks are optional, there must be at least one
    of them following try.
    
    The control flow is ended with end-try command which will execute it.
