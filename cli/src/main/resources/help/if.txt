SYNOPSIS

    if --help |
       condition_expression of command_line   

DESCRIPTION

    Starts if-else control flow.
    The if statement includes command_line (which is a CLI command
    or an operation) that is executed at the beginning of the if-else
    control flow. After the response of the command_line is received
    from the controller, it is evaluated using the condition_expression.
    condition_expression consists of a node path, equals sign ('==') and
    a specific value. If the target value designated with the node path
    equals to the specified value, then the condition is met and
    the if block (which is a batch) is executed. If the condition
    wasn't met then the else block, if present, and which is also a batch,
    would be executed.
    
    Simple example of if-else control flow which changes
    system property's value named test to the opposite boolean
    value every time it is executed:
    
    if result.value==true of /system-property=test:read-resource
        /system-property=test:write-attribute(name=value,value=false)
    else
        /system-property=test:write-attribute(name=value,value=true)

ARGUMENTS

    --help        - prints this description.
    
    command_line  - CLI command or an operation whose response
                    should be evaluated to determine which
                    block of the if-else should be executed next;
    
    condition_expression  - an expression that evaluates the response
                            and based on which the next block of the
                            if-else control flow to be executed is chosen.
