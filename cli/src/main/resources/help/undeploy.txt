    arguments, removes its content from the repository.
    If the deployment name isn't specified, prints the list of all the existing
    deployments.

ARGUMENTS

 name             - the name of the deployment to undeploy.

 --server-groups  - comma separated list of server group names the undeploy
                    command should apply to. Either server-groups or
                    all-relevant-server-groups is required in the domain mode.
                    This argument is not applicable in the standalone mode.

 --all-relevant-server-groups   - indicates that undeploy should apply to all
                                  the server groups in which the deployment is
                    enabled. Either server-groups or all-relevant-server-groups
                    is required in domain mode. This argument is not applicable
                    in the standalone mode.

 --keep-content   - by default undeploy, besides disabling the deployment, also
                    removes its content from the repository. The presence of
                    --keep-content will only disable the deployment w/o removing
                    its content from the repository. This argument can be used
                    in both standalone and domain modes.
						
 -l               - in case the deployment name isn't specified, the presence of
                    the -l switch will make the existing deployments printed one
                    deployment per line, instead of in columns (the default).

 --headers        - a list of operation headers separated by a semicolon. For
                    the list of supported headers, please, refer to the domain
                    management documentation or use tab-completion.
                          
 --path           - optional, points to a cli archive. The path can be either
                    absolute or relative to the current directory. A cli archive
                    is a zip archive containing script(s) as well as artifacts
                    or applications to deploy. To be recognized as a cli
                    archive, the extension of the archive file should be '.cli'.
                    The undeploy command will execute the script given by the
                    --script argument.                          
                          
 --script         - optional, can appear only if the file_path points a cli
                    archive. The value is the name of the script contained in a
                    cli archive to execute. If not specified, defaults to
                    'undeploy.scr'. All paths in the scripts are relative to the
                    root directory in the cli archive. The script is executed as
                    a batch.
