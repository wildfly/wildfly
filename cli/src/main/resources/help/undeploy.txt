SYNOPSIS

    undeploy name [--server-groups=group_name (,group_name)* | --all-relevant-server-groups] [--keep-content]

DESCRIPTION

    Undeploys the deployment with the given name and, depending on the arguments, removes
    its content from the repository.
    If the deployment name isn't specified, prints the list of all the existing deployments.

ARGUMENTS

 name                   - the name of the deployment to undeploy.

 --server-groups        - comma separated list of server group names the undeploy command should apply to.
                          Either server-groups or all-relevant-server-groups is required in the domain mode.
                          This argument is not applicable in the standalone mode.

 --all-relevant-server-groups   - indicates that undeploy should apply to all the server groups
                                  in which the deployment is enabled.
                                  Either server-groups or all-relevant-server-groups is required in domain mode.
                                  This argument is not applicable in the standalone mode.

 --keep-content         - by default undeploy, besides disabling the deployment, also removes its
                          content from the repository. The presence of --keep-content will only disable
                          the deployment w/o removing its content from the repository.
                          This argument can be used in both standalone and domain modes.
						
 -l                     - in case the deployment name isn't specified, the presence of the -l switch
                          will make the existing deployments printed one deployment per line, instead of
                          in columns (the default).
