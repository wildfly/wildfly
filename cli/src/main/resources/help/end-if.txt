SYNOPSIS

    end-if [--help]   

DESCRIPTION

    Ends the if block (if 'else' is not specified) or the else block
    if it's specified and triggers the execution of the if-else
    control flow by:
    - first executing the command line from the if statement;
    - evaluating its response using the specified condition expression;
    - if the condition is met, execute the if batch, otherwise -
      execute the else batch if it was specified.

    Simple example of if-else control flow which changes
    system property's value named test to the opposite boolean
    value every time it is executed:
    
    if result.value==true of /system-property=test:read-resource
        /system-property=test:write-attribute(name=value,value=false)
    else
        /system-property=test:write-attribute(name=value,value=true)
