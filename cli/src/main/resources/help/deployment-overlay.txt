SYNOPSIS

Adding a new overlay with content and optionally linking it to existing deployments

    deployment-overlay add --name=overlay_name
        --content=archive_path=fs_path(,archive_path=fs_path)*
        [--deployment=deployment_name(,deployment_name)*]
        [--headers={operation_header (;operation_header)*}]

Unlinking deployments and/or removing overlay content and/or removing an overlay completely

    deployment-overlay remove --name=overlay_name
        [--content=archive_path=(,archive_path)*]
        [--deployment=deployment_name(,deployment_name)*]
        [--headers={operation_header (;operation_header)*}]

Adding content to an existing overlay

    deployment-overlay upload --name=overlay_name
        --content=archive_path=fs_path(,archive_path=fs_path)*
        [--headers={operation_header (;operation_header)*}]

Linking deployments

    deployment-overlay link --name=overlay_name
        --deployment=deployment_name(,deployment_name)*
        [--headers={operation_header (;operation_header)*}]

Listing overlay content or linked deployments

    deployment-overlay [list-content | list-deployments] --name=overlay_name [-l]


DESCRIPTION

    The command is used to manage deployment overlays, specifically to:
    - create new deployment overlays;
    - add new deployment content to an existing overlay;
    - remove existing content from an overlay;
    - link an overlay to existing deployments;
    - unlink an overlay from deployments;
    - remove an existing overlay.
    
    The first argument of the command is the action name, which can be one of the following:
    
    - add     - creates a new deployment overlay;
    
    - remove  - depending on the arguments, it may:
    
                - if --content argument is provided,
                  remove the specified content from an existing overlay;
                  
                - if --deployment argument is provided,
                  unlink the specified deployments from an existing overlay;
                  
                - in case there are no other arguments than the --name,
                  remove the overlay with its content and links altogether.
    
    - link      - link an overlay to the specified deployments;
    
    - upload    - upload and add content to an existing overlay;
    
    - list-content  - list content of the specified overlay;
    
    - list-deployments  - list linked deployments of the specified overlay.
    
    If the command is executed without an action name,
    it will list all the existing deployment overlay names.    


ARGUMENTS

 --name              - required by any action, identifies a deployment overlay
                       to perform the action on;

 --content           - specifies the deployment overlay content.
 
                           If used with 'add' action, the format will be
                       a comma-separated list of archive_path=fs_path pairs,
                       where archive_path is the path as it will appear
                       in the linked deployment archive and fs_path is
                       the filesystem path to the file which should be
                       uploaded and become the actual content for
                       the archive_path.
                       
                           If used with 'remove' action, the format will be
                       a comma-separated list of archive_path that should be
                       removed from the overlay.

 --deployment        - a comma-separated list of deployment names that,
                       depending on the action, should be linked to or
                       unlinked from the specified overlay.

 -l                  - lists items one per line instead of organizing
                       them in columns;
                       
 --headers           - a list of operation headers separated by a semicolon. For the list of supported
                       headers, please, refer to the domain management documentation or use tab-completion.
