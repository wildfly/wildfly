SYNOPSIS

    ls [node_path] [-l]

DESCRIPTION

    Lists the contents of a node path.

ARGUMENTS

 node-path    - optional, the node path the contents of which should be printed.
                If not specified, the contents of the current node path (indicated in the prompt) will be printed.
                The node path can end on either node type (in this case the contents will be the child node names)
                or the node name (in this case the contents will be the child node types).
                If the node path has no contents, nothing will be printed.

                If specified, the node-path is expected to follow the following format:
                [node-type [=node-name (,node-type[=node-name])*]].

 -l           - by default the result is printed in columns using the whole width of the terminal,
                the -l switch will make it printed one name per line.  
				
The following navigation signs are supported in the node-path:
 /      - the root node (e.g. 'cd /' or 'cd /some=thing');
 ..     - parent node (e.g. 'cd ..');
 .type  - node type of the current node (e.g. 'cd .type').
