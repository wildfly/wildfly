SYNOPSIS

    jdbc-driver-info [driver_name]

DESCRIPTION

    Displays information about the installed (via modules or deployments) JDBC drivers.
    If the command is executed without arguments, it will list all the installed JDBC
    drivers in a table with two columns:
    
    - NAME    - the name assigned to the JDBC driver;

    - SOURCE  - it can be either a deployment name or a module name with a slot
                in the following format: module_name/slot.

    If the driver name is specified as the argument, the command will display
    all the available information about the driver.

    NOTE: in the current version, the command works only in the standalone mode,
    since the domain the drivers are installed per server and there is no
    centralized registry for the drivers.


ARGUMENTS

 driver_name         - optional, the name of an installed JDBC driver.
