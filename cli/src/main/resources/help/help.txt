Supported commands:
/connect [host]:[port] - connects to the specified host and port (default host is localhost, default port is 9999)
/help (alias /h) - prints this message
/quit (alias /q) - quit the command line interface

/prefix node-type [=node-name] [,node-type[=node-name]] (alias /to) - sets the node address prefix
 which is added to the operation request. The prefix can end on node-type.
 In that case, to execute an operation just a node-name would be sufficient (e.g. logging:read-resource).
 To move to the parent node from the current one use '..' (e.g. '/to ..').
 To move to the node type from the current node use 'type' (e.g. '/to .type').
 The root is specified with '~' (e.g. '/to ~' or '/to ~other=thing').

Commands not prefixed with '/' are treated as operation requests.
Operation requests are expected to follow the following format:

[node-type=node-name [, node-type=node-name]*] : operation-name ([name=value [, name=value]*])

e.g. profile=production,subsystem=threads,bounded-queue-thread-pool=pool1:write-core-threads(count=0, per-cpu=20)

Whitespaces between separators are insignificant.
If the address part is not specified then the ':' before the operation name is optional.
If the operation has no arguments then the brackets '()' are optional.
