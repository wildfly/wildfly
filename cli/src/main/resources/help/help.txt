For a list of commands available in the current context execute

help --commands

The resulting listing may depend on the current context. I.g. some of the commands
require an established connection to a controller (standalone or domain).
These commands won't appear in the listing unless the connection has been established.

Here are some of the most common supported commands:

 cn (or cd)				- change the current node path to the argument;
 connect				- connect to the specified host and port;
 deploy					- deploy an application;
 help (or h)			- print this message;
 history				- print or disable/enable/clear the history expansion.
 ls						- list the contents of the node path;
 pwn (or pwd)			- prints the current working node;
 quit (or q)			- quit the command line interface;
 undeploy				- undeploy an application;
 version				- prints the version and environment information.

 add-jms-queue			- creates a new JMS queue
 remove-jms-queue		- removes an existing JMS queue
 add-jms-topic			- creates a new JMS topic
 remove-jms-topic		- removes an existing JMS topic
 add-jms-cf				- creates a new JMS connection factory
 remove-jms-cf			- removes an existing JMS connection factory
 
 data-source			- allows to add new, modify and remove existing data sources
 xa-data-source			- allows to add new, modify and remove existing XA data sources
 
For a more detailed description of a specific command, execute the command with '--help' as the argument.

Tab-completion is supported for the commands, just press the tab key to start.

To use tab completion for operations requests start with './' or '/' and press the tab key
which will list the available node types or names.
If the operation request doesn't require a node path then start with ':' and press the tab key
('/:' and './:' are also possible).

Operation requests are expected to follow the format:

[node-type=node-name (, node-type=node-name)*] : operation-name ['('[name=value [, name=value]*]')']

e.g. /subsystem=web/connector=http:read-attribute(name=protocol)

Whitespaces between the separators are insignificant.
If the operation doesn't require arguments then the brackets '()' are optional.
Tab-completion for operation requests supports node types and names, operation names and the property names.
