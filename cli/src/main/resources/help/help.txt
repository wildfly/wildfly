Usage: jboss-cli.sh/jboss-cli.bat [--help] [--version] [--controller=host:port]
                                  [--connect] [--file=file_path]
                                  [--commands=command_or_operation1,command_or_operation2...]
                                  [--command=command_or_operation]
                                  [--user=username --password=password]

 --help (-h)          - prints (this) basic description of the command line utility.
 --version            - prints the version info of the JBoss AS release, JVM and system environment.
 --controller         - the default controller host and port to connect to when --connect option.
                        (described below) is specified or when the connect command is issued w/o
                        the arguments. The default controller host is localhost and the port is 9999.
 --connect (-c)       - instructs the CLI to connect to the controller on start-up (to avoid issuing
                        a separate connect command later).
 --gui                - GUI built on top of the CLI, the only difference is that it brings up a GUI 
                        instead of a command line. You have to at least pass the --connect parameter 
                        to connect from the command line when you start jboss-cli.
 --file               - specifies a path to a file which contains commands and operations (one per line)
                        that should be executed (in a non-interactive mode). The CLI will terminate the
                        session immediately after the last command has been executed or if some command
                        or operation failed.
 --command            - specifies a single command or an operation that should be executed in the CLI session.
                        The CLI will terminate the session immediately after the command or the operation
                        has been executed. Note: --command argument is optional in a sense that
                        any word (or phrase without whitespaces in it) will be assumed to be a command (or an operation).
 --commands           - specifies a comma-separated list (the list must not contain whitespaces)
                        of commands and operations that should be executed in the CLI session.
                        The CLI session will be automatically terminated as soon as
                        the last command or operation has been executed or after the first error.
                        Note: --commands argument is optional in a sense that any comma-separated list
                        at the end of the argument list will be assumed to be the list of commands and operations.
 --user               - if the controller requires user authentication, this argument can be used to specify the user name
                        as a command line argument. If the argument isn't specified and the authentication is required
                        the user will be prompted to enter the user name when the connect command is issued. 
 --password           - specifies the password for authentication while connecting to the controller as
                        a command line argument. If the argument isn't specified and the authentication is required
                        the user will be prompted to enter the password when the connect command is issued.
 

During the command line session for a list of commands available in the current context execute

help --commands

The resulting listing may depend on the current context. E.g. some of the commands
require an established connection to the controller (standalone or domain).
These commands won't appear in the listing unless the connection has been established.
Other commands may depend on the availability of specific subsystems. E.g. if the messaging
subsystem is not available, messaging-related commands will not be listed.

Here are some of the most basic supported commands:

 cn (or cd)             - change the current node path to the argument;
 connect                - connect to the specified host and port;
 deploy                 - deploy an application;
 help (or h)            - print this message;
 history                - print or disable/enable/clear the history expansion.
 ls                     - list the contents of the node path;
 pwn (or pwd)           - prints the current working node;
 quit (or q)            - quit the command line interface;
 undeploy               - undeploy an application;
 version                - prints the version and environment information.

For a more detailed description of a specific command, execute the command with '--help' as the argument.

Tab-completion is supported for the commands, just press the tab key to start.

Operation requests start with './' or '/' and follow the format:

[node-type=node-name (, node-type=node-name)*] : operation-name ['('[name=value [, name=value]*]')'] [{header (;header)*}]

e.g. /subsystem=web/connector=http:read-attribute(name=protocol)

If the operation request doesn't require a node path then the request can start with ':'
followed by an operation name and the property list if necessary ('/:' and './:' are also possible).

Whitespaces between the separators are insignificant.
If the operation doesn't require arguments then the brackets '()' are optional.
Tab-completion for operation requests supports node types and names, operation names, property names
and, in some cases, values.
