For a more detailed description of a specific command, execute the command with '--help' as the argument.

Tab-completion is supported for the commands, just press the tab key to start.

To use tab completion for operations requests start with './' or '/' and press the tab key
which will list the available node types or names.
If the operation request doesn't require a node path then start with ':' and press the tab key
('/:' and './:' are also possible).

Operation requests are expected to follow the format:

[node-type=node-name (, node-type=node-name)*] : operation-name ['('[name=value [, name=value]*]')']

e.g. /subsystem=web/connector=http:read-resource(recursive=1)

Whitespaces between the separators are insignificant.
If the operation doesn't require arguments then the brackets '()' are optional.
Tab-completion for operation requests supports node types and names, operation names and the property names.
