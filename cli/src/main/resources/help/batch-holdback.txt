SYNOPSIS

    holdback-batch [holdback_name]

DESCRIPTION

    Saves the currently active batch and exits the batch mode
    w/o executing the batch. The held back batch can later be
    re-activated by invoking batch commands.

ARGUMENTS

 holdback_name    - optional, the name under which to store the batch.
                    If the name isn't provided, the batch will be saved unnamed.
                    If the holdback name is provided, the name must be unique.
                    If there already is a held back batch with the same name,
                    holdback-batch will fail and the CLI will stay in the batch
                    mode.
