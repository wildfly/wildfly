SYNOPSIS

   cn [node_path]
   cd [node_path]

DESCRIPTION

    Changes the current node path to the argument.
    The current node path is used as the address for operation requests that
    don't contains the address part. If an operation request does include the
    address, the included address is considered relative to the current node
    path. The current node path may end on a node-type. In that case, to execute
    an operation specifying a node-name would be sufficient
    (e.g. logging:read-resource).

ARGUMENTS

 node_path      - the new value for the current node path following the format
                  [node-type [=node-name (,node-type[=node-name])*]].
				
The following navigation signs are supported in the node-path:
 /      - the root node (e.g. 'cd /' or 'cd /some=thing');
 ..     - parent node (e.g. 'cd ..');
 .type  - node type of the current node (e.g. 'cd .type').
