SYNOPSIS

    edit-batch-line line_number edited_line

DESCRIPTION

    Replaces existing command line from the currently active batch
    with the specified line number with the new one.

ARGUMENTS

 line_number    - the line number of the existing command line in the batch.
                  Line numbers start with 1. So, the value of the argument must
                  be in the range from 1 to the number of the last command in
                  the batch.
					
 edited_line    - the new value for the command line which will replace the
                  current one. The new command must be available for the batch,
                  i.e. this command must translate into an operation (or
                  operations). (Commands like cd, pwd, connect, etc are not
                  allowed in the batch, since they don't translate into
                  operations). If the new command line isn't valid for some
                  reason (syntax error or invalid arguments), edit-batch-line
                  will fail and the current command line won't be replaced with
                  the invalid one.
