SYNOPSIS

    deployment-info --name=deployment_name

DESCRIPTION

    Displays information about the deployment.
    In the standalone mode it displays the following properties

    - NAME - unique identifier of the deployment. Must be unique across all deployments;

    - RUNTIME-NAME - name by which the deployment should be known within a server's runtime.
                     This would be equivalent to the file name of a deployment file,
                     and would form the basis for such things as default JEEdition application
                     and module names. This would typically be the same as 'name',
                     but in some cases users may wish to have two deployments with the same
                     'runtime-name' (e.g. two versions of \"foo.war\") both available in
                     the deployment content repository, in which case the deployments
                     would need to have distinct 'name' values but would have the same 'runtime-name'.
                     
    - ENABLED - boolean indicating whether the deployment content is currently deployed
                in the runtime (or should be deployed in the runtime the next time the server starts.)
    
    - STATUS - the current runtime status of a deployment. Possible status modes are
               OK, FAILED, and STOPPED.
               FAILED indicates a dependency is missing or a service could not start.
               STOPPED indicates that the deployment was manually stopped.

    In the domain mode, the name and the runtime name (as in the standalone mode) are followed
    by a table with headers SERVER-GROUP and ENABLED (STATUS is not available), i.e.
    the value of ENABLED is displayed per server group. 

ARGUMENTS

 --name              - the name of the deployment.
