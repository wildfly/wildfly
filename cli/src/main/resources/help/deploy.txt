SYNOPSIS

    deploy (file_path [--name=deployment_name] [--runtime_name=deployment_runtime_name] [--force | --disabled] | --name=deployment_name)
           [--server-groups=group_name (,group_name)* | --all-server-groups]
           [--headers={operation_header (;operation_header)*}]

DESCRIPTION

    Deploys the application designated by the file_path or enables an already existing
    but disabled in the repository deployment designated by the name argument.
    If executed w/o arguments, will list all the existing deployments.

ARGUMENTS

 file_path           - the path to the application to deploy. Required in case the deployment
                       doesn't exist in the repository.
                       The path can be either absolute or relative to the current directory.

 --name              - the unique name of the deployment. If the file path argument is specified
                       the name argument is optional with the file name been the default value.
                       If the file path argument isn't specified then the command is supposed to
                       enable an already existing but disabled deployment, and in this case the
                       name argument is required.

 --runtime_name      - optional, the runtime name for the deployment.

 --force             - if the deployment with the specified name already exists, by default,
                       deploy will be aborted and the corresponding message will printed.
                       Switch --force (or -f) will force the replacement of the existing deployment
                       with the one specified in the command arguments.

 --disabled          - indicates that the deployment has to be added to the repository disabled.

 --server-groups     - comma separated list of server group names the deploy command should apply to.
                       Either server-groups or all-server-groups is required in the domain mode.
                       This argument is not applicable in the standalone mode.

 --all-server-groups - indicates that deploy should apply to all the available server groups.
                       Either server-groups or all-server-groups is required in domain mode.
                       This argument is not applicable in the standalone mode.

 -l                  - in case none of the required arguments is specified the command will
                       print all of the existing deployments in the repository. The presence of the -l switch
                       will make the existing deployments printed one deployment per line, instead of
                       in columns (the default).

 --headers           - a list of operation headers separated by a semicolon. For the list of supported
                       headers, please, refer to the domain management documentation or use tab-completion.
