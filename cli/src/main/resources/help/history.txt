SYNOPSIS

       history [--disable|--enable|--clear]

DESCRIPTION

    Manipulates the command (and operation request) history expansion.
    Without arguments prints the in-memory history of commands and operations
    previously executed and a status whether the history expansion is enabled
    or disabled.

ARGUMENTS

 --disable    - will disable history expansion (but will not clear the
                previously recorded history);

 --enable     - will re-enable history expansion (starting from the last
                recorded command before the history expansion was disabled);

 --clear      - will clear the in-memory history (but not the file one).
