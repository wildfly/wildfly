 --node              - (optional) the node path of the managed resource
                       to which the target attribute belongs.
                       If not present, the current node path (indicated in the prompt) is assumed.

                       as not having any value.
 
 --verbose (-v)      - will print all the available meta information about the attribute
                       in addition to the attribute value.
