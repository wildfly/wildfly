ARGUMENTS

 --help          - prints this message.
 
 --node          - (optional) the node path of the managed resource
                   to which the target attribute belongs.
                   If not present, the current node path (indicated in the prompt) is assumed.

                       Attributes that were not explicitly initialized, will appear
                       as not having any value.
 
 --verbose (-v)  - will print all the available meta information about the attribute
                   in addition to the attribute value.
