        <h1>No Console Active</h1>

        <p>The server configuration does not appear to have an active console. If you are running a standalone server
            check the http interface is enabled in the standalone.xml configuration, if you are running a domain the
            http interface can not be automatically detected so check the host.xml configuration and connect directly.</p>
