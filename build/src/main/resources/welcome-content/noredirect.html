        <h3>Your WildFly 8 is running.</h3>

        <h1>Unable to redirect.</h1>

        <p>An automatic redirect to the Administration Console is not currently available. This is most likely
            due to the administration console being exposed over a network interface different from the one to which
            you are connected to.</p>

        <p>To access the Administration console you should contact the administrator responsible for this
            WildFly installation and ask them to provide you with the correct address.</p>
