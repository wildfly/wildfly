/**
 * EntityBridge follows the Bridge pattern [Gamma et. al, 1995].
 * In this implementation of the pattern the Abstract is the entity bean class,
 * and the RefinedAbstraction is the entity bean dynamic proxy. This interface
 * can be considered the implementor. Each imlementation of the CMPStoreManager
 * should create a store specifiec implementaion of the bridge.
 * <p/>
 * Life-cycle:
 * Undefined. Should be tied to CMPStoreManager.
 * <p/>
 * Multiplicity:
 * One per cmp entity bean type.
