/**
 * Distributed lock manager intended for use cases where multiple local threads can share the lock, but only one node in the
 * cluster can have threads using the lock. Nodes holding the lock yield it to remote requestors if no local threads are using
 * it; otherwise remote requestors block.
 * <p>
 * The expected use case for this class is controlling access to resources that are typically only accessed on a single node
 * (e.g. web sessions or stateful session beans), with the distributed lock used primarily to guarantee that.
