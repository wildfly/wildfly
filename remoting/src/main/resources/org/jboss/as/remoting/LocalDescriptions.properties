remoting=The configuration of the Remoting subsystem.
remoting.add=Adds the Remoting subsystem
remoting.thread-pool=The "thread-pool" attribute specifies what thread pool to use for Remoting invocations and asynchronous tasks.
remoting.connectors=The remoting connectors.

remoting.connector=The configuration of a Remoting connector.
remoting.connector.add=Adds a Remoting connector.
remoting.connector.name=The unique name of this connector.
remoting.connector.socket-binding=The name (or names) of the socket binding(s) to attach to.
remoting.connector.sasl=The "sasl" element contains the SASL authentication configuration for this connector.
remoting.connector.authentication-provider=The "authentication-provider" element contains the name of the authentication provider to use for incoming connections.

remoting.sasl=The configuration of the SASL authentication layer for this server.
remoting.sasl.include-mechanisms=The optional nested "include-mechanisms" element contains a whitelist of allowed SASL mechanism names. No mechanisms will be allowed which are not present in this list.
remoting.sasl.qop=The optional nested "qop" element contains a list of quality-of-protection values, in decreasing order of preference.
remoting.sasl.strength=The optional nested "strength" element contains a list of cipher strength values, in decreasing order of preference.
remoting.sasl.reuse-session=The optional nested "reuse-session" boolean element specifies whether or not the server should attempt to reuse previously authenticated session information.  The mechanism may or may not support such reuse, and other factors may also prevent it.
remoting.sasl.server-auth=The optional nested "server-auth" boolean element specifies whether the server should authenticate to the client.  Not all mechanisms may support this setting.

remoting.sasl.policy=The optional nested "policy" boolean element specifies a policy to use to narrow down the available set of mechanisms.
remoting.sasl.policy.forward-secrecy=The optional nested "forward-secrecy" element contains a boolean value which specifies whether mechanisms that implement forward secrecy between sessions are required. Forward secrecy means that breaking into one session will not automatically provide information for breaking into future sessions.
remoting.sasl.policy.no-active=The optional nested "no-active" element contains a boolean value which specifies whether mechanisms susceptible to active (non-dictionary) attacks are not permitted. "false" to permit, "true" to deny.
remoting.sasl.policy.no-anonymous=The optional nested "no-anonymous" element contains a boolean value which specifies whether mechanisms that accept anonymous login are permitted.  "false" to permit, "true" to deny.
remoting.sasl.policy.no-dictionary=The optional nested "no-dictionary" element contains a boolean value which specifies whether mechanisms susceptible to passive dictionary attacks are permitted.  "false" to permit, "true" to deny.
remoting.sasl.policy.no-plain-text=The optional nested "no-plain-text" element contains a boolean value which specifies whether mechanisms susceptible to simple plain passive attacks (e.g., "PLAIN") are not permitted.    "false" to permit, "true" to deny.
remoting.sasl.policy.pass-credentials=The optional nested "pass-credentials" element contains a boolean value which specifies whether mechanisms that pass client credentials are required.
