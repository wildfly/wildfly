              Controls how JPA extended persistence context (XPC) inheritance is performed.  
              XPC inheritance only occurs between stateful session beans used within the same EJB3 thread.
              This might be a stateful bean that injects other stateful beans (directly or via JNDI lookup).
              
              With DEEP extended persistence inheritance, the extended persistence context is always shared at 
              the top most stateful bean level.  Even if the top level bean does not have an extended persistence 
              context, sub-beans (siblings) will share the extended persistence context (requiring fewer copies of 
              entities to be loaded).
              
              With SHALLOW extended persistence inheritance, the extended persistence context is only shared between 
              a stateful bean and its parent bean.  This means that sibling stateful beans with the same parent bean, 
              will have isolated persistence contexts (assuming the parent bean doesn't have an extended persistence 
              context).
