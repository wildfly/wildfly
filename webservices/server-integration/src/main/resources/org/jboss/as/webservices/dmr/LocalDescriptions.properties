ws=The configuration of the web services subsystem.
ws.add=Adds the web services subsystem.
deployment=Runtime resources exposed by web service components in the deployment.
endpoint=Webservice endpoint.
endpoint.name=Webservice endpoint name.
endpoint.context=Webservice endpoint context.
endpoint.class=Webservice endpoint class.
endpoint.type=Webservice endpoint type.
endpoint.wsdl=Webservice endpoint WSDL URL.
endpoint.add=Adds webservice endpoint.
endpoint.remove=Removes webservice endpoint.
modify.wsdl.address=Whether the soap address can be modified.
wsdl.host=The WSDL, that is a required deployment artifact for an endpoint, has a <soap:address> element which points to the location of the endpoint. JBoss supports rewriting of that SOAP address. If the content of <soap:address> is a valid URL, JBossWS will not rewrite it unless 'modify-wsdl-address' is true. If the content of <soap:address> is not a valid URL, JBossWS will rewrite it using the attribute values given below. If 'wsdl-host' is set to 'jbossws.undefined.host', JBossWS uses requesters host when rewriting the <soap:address>
wsdl.port=The non-secure port that will be used for rewriting the SOAP address. If absent the port will be identified by querying the list of installed connectors.
wsdl.secure.port=The secure port that will be used for rewriting the SOAP address. If absent the port will be identified by querying the list of installed connectors.
average.processing.time=Average endpoint processing time.
min.processing.time=Minimal endpoint processing time.
max.processing.time=Maximal endpoint processing time.
total.processing.time=Total endpoint processing time.
request.count=Count of requests the endpoint processed.
response.count=Count of responses the endpoint generated.
fault.count=Count of faults the endpoint generated.

endpoint.config=Webservice Endpoint configuration
endpoint.config.add=Add a new endpoint configuration
