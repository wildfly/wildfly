config-source=ConfigSource provides a source for configuration values.
config-source.add=Add a Config Source (the source of the configuration is determined by the attributes of the config-source (class to provide a new ConfigSource implementation, properties to store configuration values in WildFly  management model, etc.)
config-source.ordinal=Ordinal value for the config source
config-source.properties=Properties configured for this config source and stored directly in WildFly management model.
config-source.dir=Directory that is scanned to config properties for this config source (file names are key, file content are value)
config-source.dir.path=The path of the directory to scan. It is treated as an absolute path, unless the 'relative-to' attribute is specified, in which case the value is treated as relative to that path. If treated as an absolute path, the actual runtime pathname specified by the value of this attribute will be determined as follows: If this value is already absolute, then the value is directly used.  Otherwise the runtime pathname is resolved in a system-dependent way.  On UNIX systems, a relative pathname is made absolute by resolving it against the current user directory. On Microsoft Windows systems, a relative pathname is made absolute by resolving it against the current directory of the drive named by the pathname, if any; if not, it is resolved against the current user directory.
config-source.dir.relative-to=The name of another previously named path, or of one of the standard paths provided by the system. If 'relative-to' is provided, the value of the 'path' attribute is treated as relative to the path specified by this attribute. The standard paths provided by the system include: jboss.home - the root directory of the JBoss AS distribution, user.home - user's home directory, user.dir - user's current working directory, java.home - java installation directory, jboss.server.base.dir - root directory for an individual server instance, jboss.server.data.dir - directory the server will use for persistent data file storage, jboss.server.log.dir - directory the server will use for log file storage, jboss.server.tmp.dir - directory the server will use for temporary file storage, and jboss.domain.servers.dir - directory under which a host controller will create the working area for individual server instances.
config-source.class=Class of the config source to load
config-source.class.module=Module of the config source to load
config-source.class.name=Name of the class of the config source to load
config-source.remove=Remove the Config Source
config-source-provider=Config Source Provider can be used to register new implementation for multiple Config Sources.
config-source-provider.add=Add a Config Source Provider
config-source-provider.class=Class of the ConfigSourceProvider to load
config-source-provider.class.module=Module of the config source provider to load
config-source-provider.class.name=Name of the class of the config source to load
config-source-provider.remove=Remove the Config Source Provider
microprofile-config-smallrye=WildFLy Extension for Eclipse MicroProfile Config With SmallRye
microprofile-config-smallrye.add=Add the subsystem
microprofile-config-smallrye.remove=Remove the subsystem
