elytron-oidc-client.secure-deployment.logout-session-required=A boolean value that indicates whether `elytron-oidc-client` should enforce both `sid` and `iss` parameters when processing front-channel logout. For Back-Channel Logout the boolean value specifies whether the request requires the `sid` be included in the Logout Token.  This value must be `true` for back-channel logout to be executed.

elytron-oidc-client.secure-server.auth-server-url-for-backend-requests=Specifies the URL to use only for backend requests in order to invoke Keycloak directly without having to go through a load balancer or reverse proxy. It is recommended to provide this functionality at hosts configuration (DNS) level instead.
elytron-oidc-client.secure-server.always-refresh-token=If set to 'true', the subsystem refreshes the token every time your application receives a web request, and a new request is sent to the OpenID provider to obtain a new access token. This can result in a higher load on the OpenID provider and may impact the performance of the application.
elytron-oidc-client.secure-server.register-node-at-startup=If set to 'true', the subsystem sends a registration request to the OpenID provider. This attribute is useful only when your application is clustered.

This value should never exceed the access token lifespan. If the value is set to 0 seconds, the subsystem will refresh the token only if the token has expired.
elytron-oidc-client.secure-server.min-time-between-jwks-requests=If the subsystem recognizes a token signed by an unknown public key, it will try to download a new public key from the server. The subsystem won't try to download a public key if it already tried last in less than 'min-time-between-jwks-requests' seconds.
elytron-oidc-client.secure-server.public-key-cache-ttl=The maximum interval between two requests to retrieve new public keys in seconds. New public keys are downloaded when the subsystem recognizes a token signed by an unknown public key. Even if the token's key is already known, new public keys are downloaded periodically as per the interval set here at least once.
elytron-oidc-client.secure-server.ignore-oauth-query-parameter=Disable query parameter parsing for the 'access_token'. Users will not be able to authenticate if they only pass in an 'access_token'.
