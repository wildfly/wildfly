/**
 * A registry to which individual {@link javax.ejb.TimerService timer services} can register to (and un-register from). The main purpose
 * of this registry is to provide an implementation of {@link #getAllActiveTimers()} which returns all
 * {@link javax.ejb.TimerService#getTimers() active timers} after querying each of the {@link javax.ejb.TimerService timer services} registered
 * with this {@link TimerServiceRegistry registry}.
 * <p/>
 * Typical use of this registry is to maintain one instance of this registry, per deployment unit (also known as Jakarta Enterprise Beans module) and register the timer
 * services of all Jakarta Enterprise Beans components that belong to that deployment unit. Effectively, such an instance can then be used to fetch all active timers
 * that are applicable to that deployment unit (a.k.a Jakarta Enterprise Beans module).
