deployment.scanner=The configuration of the deployment scanner subsystem
deployment.scanner.subsystem.add=Add the deployment scanner subsystem.
deployment.scanner.subsystem.remove=Remove the deployment scanner subsystem.
deployment.scanner.subsystem.scanner=The scanners maintained by the subsystem.
deployment.scanner.subsystem=An individual deployment scanner that scans a particular location
deployment.scanner.relative-to=Reference to a filesystem path defined in the "paths" section of the server configuration.
deployment.scanner.path=The actual filesystem path to be scanned. Treated as an absolute path, unless the 'relative-to' attribute is specified, in which case the value is treated as relative to that path.

deployment.scanner.auto-deploy-zipped=Allows automatic deployment of zipped content without requiring a .dodeploy marker file.
deployment.scanner.auto-deploy-xml=Allows automatic deployment of XML content without requiring a .dodeploy marker file.
deployment.scanner.scan-enabled=Flag indicating that all scanning (including initial scanning at startup) should be disabled.
deployment.scanner.scan-interval=Periodic interval, in milliseconds, at which the repository should be scanned for changes. A value of less than 1 indicates the repository should only be scanned at initial startup.
deployment.scanner.deployment-timeout=The time value in seconds for the deployment scanner to allow a deployment attempt before being cancelled.
deployment.scanner.runtime-failure-causes-rollback=Flag indicating whether a runtime failure of a deployment causes a rollback of the deployment as well as all other (maybe unrelated) deployments as part of the scan operation.
deployment.scanner.add=Add a new deployment scanner
