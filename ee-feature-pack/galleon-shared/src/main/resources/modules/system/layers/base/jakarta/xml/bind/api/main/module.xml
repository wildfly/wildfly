        <!-- Export the implementation as the TCCL is typically the CL of a deployment. We do not want to export the
             services as that would trigger the loading through the service loader. This can be an issue and require
             special permissions if the security manager is present. Not exporting the services falls back to a default
             implementation provided by the org.glassfish.jaxb module.

             Please note the comment in WFLY-17065. The org.glassfish.jaxb module includes more than one module. While
             it is likely not an issue to NOT export the services, it should be noted this currently affects;
             jaxb-runtime.jar and jaxb-xjc.jar.
