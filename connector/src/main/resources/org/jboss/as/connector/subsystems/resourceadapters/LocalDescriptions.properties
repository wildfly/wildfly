blocking-timeout-wait-millis=The blocking-timeout-millis element indicates the maximum time in milliseconds to block while waiting for a connection before throwing an exception. Note that this blocks only while waiting for a permit for a connection, and will never throw an exception if creating a new connection takes an inordinately long time.
idle-timeout-minutes=The idle-timeout-minutes elements indicates the maximum time in minutes a connection may be idle before being closed. The actual maximum time depends also on the IdleRemover scan time, which is 1/2 the smallest idle-timeout-minutes of any pool. 
set-tx-query-timeout=Whether to set the query timeout based on the time remaining until transaction timeout, any configured query timeout will be used if there is no transaction. 
xa-resource-timeout=Passed to XAResource.setTransactionTimeout() Default is zero which does not invoke the setter. In seconds
query-timeout=Any configured query timeout in seconds The default is no timeout 
use-try-lock=Any configured timeout for internal locks on the resource adapter objects in seconds 
user-name=Specify the username used when creating a new connection. 
password=Specify the passwprd used when creating a new connection. 
security-domain=Indicates Subject (from security domain) are used to distinguish connections in the pool. The content of the security-domain is the name of the JAAS security manager that will handleauthentication. This name correlates to the JAAS login-config.xml descriptor application-policy/name attribute.
security-domain-and-application= Indicates that either app supplied parameters (such as from getConnection(user, pw)) or Subject (from security domain) are used to distinguish connections in the pool. The content of the security-domain is the name of the JAAS security manager that will handle authentication. This name correlates to the JAAS login-config.xml descriptor application-policy/name attribute.
security-application=Indicates that app supplied parameters (such as from getConnection(user, pw)) are used to distinguish connections in the pool.
share-prepared-statements=Whether to share prepare statements, i.e. whether asking for same statement twice without closing uses the same underlying prepared statement
prepared-statements-cacheSize=The number of prepared statements per connection in an LRU cache
track-statements=Whether to check for unclosed statements when a connection is returned to the pool and result sets are closed when a statement is closed/return to the prepared statement cache. valid values are: false - do not track statements and results true - track statements and result sets and warn when they are not closed nowarn - track statements but do no warn about them being unclosed 
valid-connection-checker-class-name=An org.jboss.jca.adapters.jdbc.ValidConnectionChecker that provides a SQLException isValidConnection(Connection e) method to validate is a connection is valid. An exception means the connection is destroyed. This overrides the check-valid-connection-sql when present.
check-valid-connection-sql= Specify an SQL statement to check validity of a pool connection. This may be called when managed connection is taken from pool for use. 
validate-on-match=The validate-on-match element indicates whether or not connection level validation should be done when a connection factory attempts to match a managed connection for a given set. This is typically exclusive to the use of background validation 
stale-connection-checker-class-name=An org.jboss.jca.adapters.jdbc.StaleConnectionChecker that provides a boolean isStaleConnection(SQLException e) method which if it it returns true will wrap the exception in an org.jboss.jca.adapters.jdbc.StaleConnectionException 
background-validation-minutes=The background-validation-minutes element specifies the amount of time, in seconds, that background validation will run. 
background-validation-millis=The background-validation-millis element specifies the amount of time, in milliseconds, that background validation will run. 
background-validation=An element to specify that connections should be validated on a background thread versus being validated prior to use 
use-fast-fail=Whether fail a connection allocation on the first connection if it is invalid (true) or keep trying until the pool is exhausted of all potential connections (false) 
useFastFail=Whether fail a connection allocation on the first connection if it is invalid (true) or keep trying until the pool is exhausted of all potential connections (false)

interliving=An element to enable interleaving for XA connection factories 
no-tx-separate-pool=Oracle does not like XA connections getting used both inside and outside a JTA transaction. To workaround the problem you can create separate sub-pools for the different context
