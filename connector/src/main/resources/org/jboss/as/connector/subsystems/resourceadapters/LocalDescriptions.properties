ironjacamar=Model representing resource adapters activated by ironjacamar.xml file inside rar
resource-adapter.add=Add a new resource adapter
resourceadapter.remove=Remove the resource adapter
resourceadapter.activate=Force the resource adapter config activation without server reload
deployment-subsystem=Runtime information for resource adapters. It contains statistics and ironjacamar.xml activated resource-adapter information and operations
resourceadapter.flush-idle-connection-in-pool=Flushes all idle connections in the pool
resourceadapter.flush-all-connection-in-pool=Flushes all connections in the pool
resourceadapter.test-connection-in-pool=Test if a connection can be obtained
resourceadapter.clear-statistics=Clear statistics values for this resource


config-properties=Custom defined config properties
config-properties.add=Add a custom defined config property
config-properties.remove=Remove the custom defined config property
config-properties.value=Custom defined config property value

connection-definitions=Specifies the connection definitions
connection-definition=Specifies a connection definition
connection-definition.add=Add a connection definition
connection-definition.remove=Remove the connection definition

admin-objects=Specifies the administration objects
admin-object=Specifies an administration object
admin-object.add=Add an administration object
admin-object.remove=Remove the administration object

allocation-retry-wait-millis=The allocation retry wait millis element specifies the amount of time, in milliseconds, to wait between retrying to allocate a connection
allocation-retry=The allocation retry element indicates the number of times that allocating a connection should be tried before throwing an exception
archive=Specifies the resource adapter archive

background-validation-millis=The background-validation-millis element specifies the amount of time, in milliseconds, that background validation will run. Changing this value requires a server restart
background-validation=An element to specify that connections should be validated on a background thread versus being validated prior to use. Changing this value requires a server restart
beanvalidationgroups=Specifies the bean validation groups that should be used
blocking-timeout-wait-millis=The blocking-timeout-millis element specifies the maximum time, in milliseconds, to block while waiting for a connection before throwing an exception. Note that this blocks only while waiting for locking a connection, and will never throw an exception if creating a new connection takes an inordinately long time
bootstrap-context=Specifies the unique name of the bootstrap context that should be used

class-name=Specifies the fully qualified class name of a managed connection factory or admin object

enabled=Specifies if the resource adapter should be enabled

flush-strategy=Specifies how the pool should be flush in case of an error. Valid values are: FailingConnectionOnly (default), IdleConnections and EntirePool

idle-timeout-minutes=The idle-timeout-minutes elements specifies the maximum time, in minutes, a connection may be idle before being closed. The actual maximum time depends also on the IdleRemover scan time, which is half of the smallest idle-timeout-minutes value of any pool. Changing this value requires a server restart.
interleaving=An element to enable interleaving for XA connections

jndi-name=Specifies the JNDI name for the connection factory or admin object

max-pool-size=The max-pool-size element specifies the maximum number of connections for a pool. No more connections will be created in each sub-pool
min-pool-size=The min-pool-size element specifies the minimum number of connections for a pool

no-tx-separate-pool=Oracle does not like XA connections getting used both inside and outside a JTA transaction. To workaround the problem you can create separate sub-pools for the different contexts

pad-xid=Should the Xid be padded
password=Specifies the password used when creating a new connection
pool-name=Specifies the pool name for the datasource used for management
pool-prefill=Should the pool be prefilled. Changing this value requires a server restart
pool-use-strict-min=Specifies if the min-pool-size should be considered strictly

query-timeout=Any configured query timeout in seconds The default is no timeout

same-rm-override=The is-same-rm-override element allows one to unconditionally set whether the javax.transaction.xa.XAResource.isSameRM(XAResource) returns true or false
security-application=Indicates that app supplied parameters (such as from getConnection(user, pw)) are used to distinguish connections in the pool
security-domain=Specifies the security domain which defines the javax.security.auth.Subject that are used to distinguish connections in the pool
security-domain-and-application=Indicates that either app supplied parameters (such as from getConnection(user, pw)) or Subject (from security domain) are used to distinguish connections in the pool
set-tx-query-timeout=Whether to set the query timeout based on the time remaining until transaction timeout. Any configured query timeout will be used if there is no transaction

transaction-support=Specifies the transaction support level of the resource adapter

use-ccm=Enable the use of a cached connection manager
use-fast-fail=Whether to fail a connection allocation on the first try if it is invalid (true) or keep trying until the pool is exhausted of all potential connections (false)
use-java-context=Setting this to false will bind the object into global JNDI
use-try-lock=Any configured timeout for internal locks on the resource adapter objects in seconds
user-name=Specify the user name used when creating a new connection

wrap-xa-resource=Should the XAResource instances be wrapped in a org.jboss.tm.XAResourceWrapper instance
xa-resource-timeout=The value is passed to XAResource.setTransactionTimeout(), in seconds. Default is zero

statistics=Runtime statistics provided by the resource adapter.

recovery-username=The user name used for recovery
recovery-password=The password used for recovery
recovery-security-domain=The security domain used for recovery
recovery-plugin-class-name=The fully qualified class name of the recovery plugin implementation
recovery-plugin-properties=The properties for the recovery plugin
no-recovery=Specifies if the connection pool should be excluded from recovery
