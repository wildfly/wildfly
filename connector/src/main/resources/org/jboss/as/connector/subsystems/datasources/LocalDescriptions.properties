Note that this blocks only while waiting for locking a connection, and will never throw an exception if creating a new connection takes an inordinately long time

datasources.xa-data-source.check-valid-connection-sql=Specify an SQL statement to check validity of a pool connection. This may be called when managed connection is obtained from the pool

datasources.xa-data-source.recovery-password=The password used for recovery
datasources.xa-data-source.recovery-security-domain=The security domain used for recovery
datasources.xa-data-source.recovery-elytron-enabled=Enables Elytron security for handling authentication of connections for recovery. The Elytron authentication-context to be used will be current context if no context is specified (see authentication-context).
datasources.xa-data-source.recovery-credential-reference=Credential (from Credential Store) to authenticate on data source
datasources.xa-data-source.recovery-credential-reference.store=The name of the credential store holding the alias to credential
datasources.xa-data-source.recovery-credential-reference.type=The type of credential this reference is denoting
datasources.xa-data-source.recovery-credential-reference.alias=The alias which denotes stored secret or credential in the store
datasources.xa-data-source.recovery-credential-reference.clear-text=Secret specified using clear text (check credential store way of supplying credential/secrets to services)
datasources.xa-data-source.recovery-authentication-context=The Elytron authentication context which defines the javax.security.auth.Subject that is used to distinguish connections in the pool.
datasources.xa-data-source.recovery-plugin-properties.recovery-plugin-class-name=The fully qualified class name of the recovery plugin implementation
datasources.xa-data-source.recovery-plugin-class-name=The fully qualified class name of the recovery plugin implementation
datasources.xa-data-source.recovery-plugin-properties=The properties for the recovery plugin
datasources.xa-data-source.no-recovery=Specifies if the connection pool should be excluded from recovery
datasources.xa-data-source.statistics-enabled=Define whether runtime statistics are enabled or not.
