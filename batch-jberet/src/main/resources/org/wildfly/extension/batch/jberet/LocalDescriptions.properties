batch.jberet.restart-jobs-on-resume=If set to true when a resume operation has be invoked after a suspend operation any \
  jobs stopped during the suspend will be restarted. A value of false will leave the jobs in a stopped state.
batch.jberet.security-domain=References the security domain for batch jobs. This can only be defined if the Elytron \
  subsystem is available.

# In-Memory job repository
batch.jberet.in-memory-job-repository=A job repository that stores job information in memory.

# Thread pool
batch.jberet.thread-pool=The thread pool used for batch jobs. Note that the max-thread attribute should always be greater \

threadpool.common.keepalive-time.unit=The time unit
threadpool.common.largest-thread-count=The largest number of threads that have ever simultaneously been in the pool.

threadpool.common.queue-size=The queue size.
threadpool.common.task-count=The approximate total number of tasks that have ever been scheduled for execution.
threadpool.common.thread-factory=Specifies the name of a specific thread factory to use to create worker threads. If not defined an appropriate default thread factory will be used.
