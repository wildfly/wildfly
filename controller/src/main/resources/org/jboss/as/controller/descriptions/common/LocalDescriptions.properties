# Paths
named_path=A named filesystem path, but without a requirement to specify the actual path.

path.name=The name of the path. Cannot be one of the standard fixed paths provided by the system: <ul><li>jboss.home - the root directory of the JBoss AS distribution</li><li>user.home - user's home directory</li><li>user.dir - user's current working directory</li><li>java.home - java installation directory</li><li>jboss.server.base.dir - root directory for an individual server instance</li></ul> Note that the system provides other standard paths that can be overridden by declaring them in the configuration file. See the 'relative-to' attribute documentation for a complete list of standard paths.
path.path=The actual filesystem path. Treated as an absolute path, unless the 'relative-to' attribute is specified, in which case the value is treated as relative to that path. <p>If treated as an absolute path, the actual runtime pathname specified by the value of this attribute will be determined as follows: </p>If this value is already absolute, then the value is directly used.  Otherwise the runtime pathname is resolved in a system-dependent way.  On UNIX systems, a relative pathname is made absolute by resolving it against the current user directory. On Microsoft Windows systems, a relative pathname is made absolute by resolving it against the current directory of the drive named by the pathname, if any; if not, it is resolved against the current user directory.
path.relative-to=The name of another previously named path, or of one of the standard paths provided by the system. If 'relative-to' is provided, the value of the 'path' attribute is treated as relative to the path specified by this attribute.

A 'loopback address' may not actually be configured on the machine's loopback interface. Differs from inet-address in that the given value will be used even if no NIC can be found that has the IP specified address associated with it. An 'undefined' or 'false' value means this attribute is not relevant to the IP address selection.

interface.nic=Attribute indicating that part of the selection criteria for choosing an IP address for this interface should be whether its network interface has the given name. The name of a network interface (e.g. eth0, eth1, lo). An 'undefined' value means this attribute is not relevant to the IP address selection.

An 'undefined' value means this attribute is not relevant to the IP address selection.
interface.point-to-point=Attribute indicating that part of the selection criteria for choosing an IP address for this interface should be whether or not its network interface is a point-to-point interface. An 'undefined' or 'false' value means this attribute is not relevant to the IP address selection

interface.site-local-address=Attribute indicating that part of the selection criteria for choosing an IP address for this interface should be whether or it is a site-local address. An 'undefined' or 'false' value means this attribute is not relevant to the IP address selection
interface.subnet-match=Attribute indicating that part of the selection criteria for choosing an IP address for this interface should be whether or it the address fits in the given subnet definition. Value is a network IP address and the number of bits in the address' network prefix, written in "slash notation"; e.g. "192.168.0.0/16". An 'undefined' value means this attribute is not relevant to the IP address selection.
interface.up=Attribute indicating that part of the selection criteria for choosing an IP address for this interface should be whether its network interface is currently up. An 'undefined' or 'false' value means this attribute is not relevant to the IP address selection
interface.virtual=Attribute indicating that part of the selection criteria for choosing an IP address for this interface should be whether its network interface is a virtual interface. An 'undefined' or 'false' value means this attribute is not relevant to the IP address selection
interface.not=Attribute indicating that part of the selection criteria for choosing an IP address for this interface should be that the IP address *does not* meet any of a nested set of criteria. The value of the attribute is a set of criteria (e.g. 'loopback') whose normal meaning is reversed. An 'undefined' value means this attribute is not relevant to the IP address selection.
interface.any=Attribute indicating that part of the selection criteria for choosing an IP address for this interface should be that the IP address meets at least one of a nested set of criteria, but not necessarily all of the nested criteria. The value of the attribute is a set of criteria. An 'undefined' value means this attribute is not relevant to the IP address selection.

deployment.runtime-name=Name by which the deployment should be known within a server's runtime. This would be equivalent to the file name of a deployment file, and would form the basis for such things as default Java Enterprise Edition application and module names. This would typically be the same as 'name', but in some cases users may wish to have two deployments with the same 'runtime-name' (e.g. two versions of "foo.war") both available in the deployment content repository, in which case the deployments would need to have distinct 'name' values but would have the same 'runtime-name'.

deployment.persistent=Boolean indicating whether the existence of the deployment should be recorded in the persistent server configuration. Only relevant to a standalone mode server. Default is 'true'. A deployment managed by a deployment scanner would have this set to 'false' to ensure the deployment is only deployed at server start if the scanner again detects the deployment.

deployment.bytes=Byte array containing the deployment content that should uploaded to the domain's or standalone server's deployment content repository..
deployment.upload-url=Indicates that the deployment content available at the included URL should be added to the deployment content repository. Note that this operation does not indicate the content should be deployed into the runtime.
deployment.url=The URL at which the deployment content is available for upload to the domain's or standalone server's deployment content repository.. Note that the URL must be accessible from the target of the operation (i.e. the Domain Controller or standalone server).

deployment.path=Path (relative or absolute) to unmanaged content that is part of the deployment.
deployment.relative-to=Name of a system path to which the value of the 'path' is relative. If not set, the 'path' is considered to be absolute.
deployment.archive=Flag indicating whether unmanaged content is a zip archive (true) or exploded (false).
deployment.add=Adds previously uploaded content to the list of content available for use. Does not actually deploy the content unless the 'enabled' parameter is 'true'.
deployment.deploy=Deploy the specified deployment content into the runtime, optionally replacing existing content.
deployment.deploy.name=The name of the new content.

deployment.full-replace=Add previously uploaded deployment content to the list of content available for use, replace existing content of the same name in the runtime, and remove the replaced content from the list of content available for use. This is equivalent to an 'add', 'undeploy', 'deploy', 'remove' sequence where the new content has the same name as the content being replaced. Precisely one of 'runtime-name', 'hash', 'input-stream-index', 'bytes' or 'url' must be specified.
deployment.undeploy=Undeploy content from the runtime. The content remains in the list of content available for use.
deployment.redeploy=Undeploy existing content from the runtime and deploy it again.
deployment.status=The current runtime status of a deployment. Possible status modes are OK, FAILED, and STOPPED. FAILED indicates a dependency is missing or a service could not start. STOPPED indicates that the deployment was manually stopped.
deployment.subsystem=Runtime resources created when the deployment is deployed, organized by the subsystem responsible for the runtime resource.
deployment.subdeployment=Runtime resources associated with a child deployment packaged inside another deployment; for example a war packaged inside an ear.
