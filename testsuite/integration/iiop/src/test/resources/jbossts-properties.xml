    This is the JBossTS configuration file for running ArjunaJTS.
    It should be called jbossts-properties.xml.
    You need a different version for ArjunaCore or JTA usage.

    ***************************

    Property values may be literals or be tokens of the form ${p1[,p2][:v]}
    in which case the token values are substituted for the values of the corresponding system
    properties as follows:

    - Any occurance of ${p} with the System.getProperty(p) value.
    If there is no such property p defined, then the ${p} reference will remain unchanged.

    - If the property reference is of the form ${p:v} and there is no such property p,
    then the default value v will be returned.

    - If the property reference is of the form ${p1,p2} or ${p1,p2:v} then
    the primary and the secondary properties will be tried in turn, before
    returning either the unchanged input, or the default value.

    The property ${/} is replaced with System.getProperty("file.separator")
    value and the property ${:} is replaced with System.getProperty("path.separator").

    Note this substitution applies to property values only at the point they are read from
    the config file. Tokens in system properties won't be substituted.
