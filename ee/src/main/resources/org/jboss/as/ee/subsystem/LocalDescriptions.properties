context-service.jndi-name=The JNDI Name to lookup the context service.
context-service.use-transaction-setup-provider=Flag which indicates if the transaction setup provider should be used

managed-executor-service.thread-priority=The priority applied to threads created by the executor.
managed-executor-service.hung-task-threshold=The runtime, in milliseconds, for tasks to be considered hung by the managed executor service. If value is 0 tasks are never considered hung.
managed-executor-service.long-running-tasks=Flag which hints the duration of tasks executed by the executor.
managed-executor-service.core-threads=The minimum number of threads to be used by the executor. If left undefined the \
  default core-size is calculated based on the number of processors. A value of zero is not advised and in some cases invalid. \
  See the queue-length attribute for details on how this value is used to determine the queuing strategy.
managed-executor-service.max-threads=The maximum number of threads to be used by the executor. If left undefined the value \
  from core-size will be used. This value is ignored if an unbounded queue is used (only core-threads will be used in that case).

managed-executor-service.queue-length=The executors task queue capacity. A length of 0 means direct hand-off and \
  possible rejection will occur. An undefined length (the default), or Integer.MAX_VALUE, indicates that an unbounded queue \
  should be used. All other values specify an exact queue size. If an unbounded queue or direct hand-off is used, a \
  core-threads value greater than zero is required.
managed-executor-service.reject-policy=The policy to be applied to aborted tasks.
managed-executor-service.active-thread-count=The approximate number of threads that are actively executing tasks.

managed-executor-service.refuse-lifecycle-operation=Lifecycle operation not supported.

managed-scheduled-executor-service=A managed scheduled executor service
managed-scheduled-executor-service.add=Adds the scheduled executor

managed-scheduled-executor-service.jndi-name=The JNDI Name to lookup the managed scheduled executor service.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.context-service=The name of the context service to be used by the scheduled executor.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.thread-factory=The name of the thread factory to be used by the scheduled executor.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.thread-factory.deprecated=Deprecated, the executor's thread factory should be configured using attribute named thread-priority.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.thread-priority=The priority applied to threads created by the executor.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.hung-task-threshold=The runtime, in milliseconds, for tasks to be considered hung by the scheduled executor. If 0 tasks are never considered hung.

managed-scheduled-executor-service.keepalive-time=When the number of threads is greater than the core, this is the maximum time, in milliseconds, that excess idle threads will wait for new tasks before terminating.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.reject-policy=The policy to be applied to aborted tasks.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.active-thread-count=The approximate number of threads that are actively executing tasks.

global-directory=Global directory that can be used to supply libraries across all deployed applications.
global-directory.add=Adds a global directory
global-directory.remove=Removes a global directory
global-directory.path=The path of the directory to scan. It is treated as an absolute path, unless the 'relative-to' attribute is specified, in which case the value is treated as relative to that path. If treated as an absolute path, the actual runtime pathname specified by the value of this attribute will be determined as follows: If this value is already absolute, then the value is directly used. Otherwise, the runtime pathname is resolved in a system-dependent way.  On UNIX systems, a relative pathname is made absolute by resolving it against the current user directory. On Microsoft Windows systems, a relative pathname is made absolute by resolving it against the current directory of the drive named by the pathname, if any; if not, it is resolved against the current user directory.
global-directory.relative-to=The name of another previously named path, or one of the standard paths provided by the system. If 'relative-to' is provided, the value of the 'path' attribute is treated as relative to the path specified by this attribute. The standard paths provided by the system include: jboss.home - the root directory of the JBoss AS distribution, user.home - user's home directory, user.dir - user's current working directory, java.home - java installation directory, jboss.server.base.dir - root directory for an individual server instance, jboss.server.data.dir - directory the server will use for persistent data file storage, jboss.server.log.dir - directory the server will use for log file storage, jboss.server.tmp.dir - directory the server will use for temporary file storage, and jboss.domain.servers.dir - directory under which a host controller will create the working area for individual server instances.
