ee=The configuration of the EE subsystem.
ee.add=Adds the EE subsystem.
ee.remove=Removes the EE subsystem.
ee.global-modules=A list of modules that should be made available to all deployments.
ee.global-modules.name=The name of the module
ee.global-modules.slot=The module's slot
ee.global-modules.annotations=If a pre-computed annotation index should be imported from META-INF/jandex.idx
ee.global-modules.meta-inf=If a modules META-INF directory should be made available to the deployments class loader
ee.global-modules.services=If any services exposed in META-INF/services should be made available to the deployments class loader
ee.ear-subdeployments-isolated=Flag indicating whether each of the subdeployments within a .ear can access classes belonging to another subdeployment within the same .ear. A value of false means the subdeployments can see classes belonging to other subdeployments within the .ear.
ee.spec-descriptor-property-replacement=Flag indicating whether descriptors defined by the Java EE specification will have property replacements applied
ee.jboss-descriptor-property-replacement=Flag indicating whether JBoss specific deployment descriptors will have property replacements applied
ee.annotation-property-replacement=Flag indicating whether Java EE annotations will have property replacements applied

service=Centrally configurable services that are part of the EE subsystem.

context-service=A context service
context-service.add=Adds a context service
context-service.remove=Removes a context service
context-service.jndi-name=The JNDI Name to lookup the context service.
context-service.use-transaction-setup-provider=Flag which indicates if the transaction setup provider should be used

managed-thread-factory=A managed thread factory
managed-thread-factory.add=Adds the managed thread factory
managed-thread-factory.remove=Removes the managed thread factory
managed-thread-factory.jndi-name=The JNDI Name to lookup the managed thread factory.
managed-thread-factory.context-service=The name of the context service to be used by the managed thread factory
managed-thread-factory.priority=The priority applied to threads created by the factory

managed-executor-service=A managed executor service
managed-executor-service.add=Adds the executor
managed-executor-service.remove=Removes the executor.
managed-executor-service.jndi-name=The JNDI Name to lookup the managed executor service.
managed-executor-service.context-service=The name of the context service to be used by the executor.
managed-executor-service.thread-factory=The name of the thread factory to be used by the executor.
managed-executor-service.hung-task-threshold=The runtime, in milliseconds, for tasks to be considered hung by the managed executor service. If value is 0 tasks are never considered hung.
managed-executor-service.long-running-tasks=Flag which hints the duration of tasks executed by the executor.
managed-executor-service.core-threads=The minimum number of threads to be used by the executor. If left undefined the \
  default core-size is calculated based on the number of processors. A value of zero is not advised and in some cases invalid. \
  See the queue-length attribute for details on how this value is used to determine the queuing strategy.
managed-executor-service.max-threads=The maximum number of threads to be used by the executor. If left undefined the value \
  from core-size will be used. This value is ignored if an unbounded queue is used (only core-threads will be used in that case).
managed-executor-service.keepalive-time=When the number of threads is greater than the core, this is the maximum time, in milliseconds, that excess idle threads will wait for new tasks before terminating.
managed-executor-service.queue-length=The executors task queue capacity. A length of 0 means direct hand-off and \
  possible rejection will occur. An undefined length (the default), or Integer.MAX_VALUE, indicates that an unbounded queue \
  should be used. All other values specify an exact queue size. If an unbounded queue or direct hand-off is used, a \
  core-threads value greater than zero is required.
managed-executor-service.reject-policy=The policy to be applied to aborted tasks.

managed-scheduled-executor-service=A managed scheduled executor service
managed-scheduled-executor-service.add=Adds the scheduled executor
managed-scheduled-executor-service.remove=Removes the scheduled executor.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.jndi-name=The JNDI Name to lookup the managed scheduled executor service.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.context-service=The name of the context service to be used by the scheduled executor.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.thread-factory=The name of the thread factory to be used by the scheduled executor.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.hung-task-threshold=The runtime, in milliseconds, for tasks to be considered hung by the scheduled executor. If 0 tasks are never considered hung.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.long-running-tasks=Flag which hints the duration of tasks executed by the scheduled executor.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.core-threads=The minimum number of threads to be used by the scheduled executor.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.keepalive-time=When the number of threads is greater than the core, this is the maximum time, in milliseconds, that excess idle threads will wait for new tasks before terminating.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.reject-policy=The policy to be applied to aborted tasks.

default-bindings=The JNDI names for the default EE bindings
default-bindings.add=Adds the JNDI names for the default EE bindings
default-bindings.remove=Removes the JNDI names for the default EE bindings
default-bindings.context-service=The JNDI name where the default EE Context Service can be found
default-bindings.datasource=The JNDI name where the default EE Datasource can be found
default-bindings.jms-connection-factory=The JNDI name where the default EE JMS Connection Factory can be found
default-bindings.managed-executor-service=The JNDI name where the default EE Managed Executor Service can be found
default-bindings.managed-scheduled-executor-service=The JNDI name where the default EE Managed Scheduled Executor Service can be found
default-bindings.managed-thread-factory=The JNDI name where the default EE Managed Thread Factory can be found
