This number refers to the number of bytes of randomness that are used to generate the session ID, the actual ID that is sent to the client will be base64 encoded so will be approximately 33% larger (e.g. a session id length of 30 will result in a cookie value of length 40).

undertow.byte-buffer-pool.remove=Removes a byte buffer pool
undertow.byte-buffer-pool.direct=If this is true the buffer pool will use direct buffers, this is recommended for best performance
undertow.byte-buffer-pool.max-pool-size=The maximum amount of buffers to keep in the pool. If more buffers are required at runtime they will be allocated dynamically. Setting this to zero effectively disables pooling.

undertow.listener.redirect-socket=If this listener is supporting non-SSL requests, and a request is received for which a matching <security-constraint> requires SSL transport, undertow will automatically redirect the request to the socket binding port specified here.
undertow.listener.proxy-address-forwarding=Enables  handling of x-forwarded-host header (and other x-forwarded-* headers) and use this header information to set the remote address. This should only be used behind a trusted proxy that sets these headers otherwise a remote user can spoof their IP address.

  buffered in order to perform the renegotiation.

undertow.listener.allow-equals-in-cookie-value=If this is true then Undertow will allow non-escaped equals characters in unquoted cookie values. \
  Unquoted cookie values may not contain equals characters. If present the value ends before the equals sign. The remainder of the cookie value will be dropped.

undertow.listener.allow-unescaped-characters-in-url=If this is true Undertow will accept non-encoded characters that are disallowed by the URI specification. This defaults to false, and in general should not be needed as most clients correctly encode characters. Note that setting this to true can be considered a security risk, as allowing non-standard characters can allow request smuggling attacks in some circumstances.
undertow.listener.receive-buffer=The receive buffer size, in bytes.
undertow.listener.send-buffer=The send buffer size, in bytes.
undertow.listener.max-connections=The maximum number of concurrent connections. Only values greater than 0 are allowed. For unlimited connections simply undefine this attribute value.
