undertow.servlet-container.use-listener-encoding=Use encoding defined on listener
undertow.servlet-container.ignore-flush=Ignore flushes on the servlet output stream. In most cases these just hurt performance for no good reason.

undertow.servlet-container.eager-filter-initialization=If true undertow calls filter init() on deployment start rather than when first requested.
undertow.servlet-container.default-session-timeout=The default session timeout (in minutes) for all applications deployed in the container.
undertow.servlet-container.use-global-request-controller=If this is true Undertow will register itself with the global request controller. This has a slight performance impact, but allows for graceful shutdown and a global limit on the number of requests active in the server.
undertow.servlet-container.disable-caching-for-secured-pages=If Undertow should set headers to disable caching for secured paged. Disabling this can cause security problems, as sensitive pages may be cached by an intermediary.

This number refers to the number of bytes of randomness that are used to generate the session ID, the actual ID that is sent to the client will be base64 encoded so will be approximately 33% larger (e.g. a session id length of 30 will result in a cookie value of length 40).

undertow.byte-buffer-pool.remove=Removes a byte buffer pool
undertow.byte-buffer-pool.direct=If this is true the buffer pool will use direct buffers, this is recommended for best performance
undertow.byte-buffer-pool.max-pool-size=The maximum amount of buffers to keep in the pool. If more buffers are required at runtime they will be allocated dynamically. Setting this to zero effectively disables pooling.
undertow.byte-buffer-pool.buffer-size=The size of the buffer

undertow.listener.scheme=The listener scheme, can be HTTP or HTTPS. By default the scheme will be taken from the incoming AJP request.
undertow.listener.certificate-forwarding=If certificate forwarding should be enabled. If this is enabled then the listener will take the certificate from the SSL_CLIENT_CERT attribute. This should only be enabled if behind a proxy, and the proxy is configured to always set these headers.
undertow.listener.ssl-context=Reference to the SSLContext to be used by this listener.
undertow.listener.security-realm=The listeners security realm
undertow.listener.security-realm.deprecated=Use the ssl-context attribute to reference a configured SSLContext directly.

undertow.listener.decode-url=If this is true then the parser will decode the URL and query parameters using the selected character encoding (UTF-8 by default). \
  If this is false they will not be decoded. This will allow a later handler to decode them into whatever charset is desired.
undertow.listener.url-charset=URL charset

undertow.listener.verify-client=The desired SSL client authentication mode for SSL channels
undertow.listener.verify-client.deprecated=Where an SSLContext is referenced it should be configured directly for the required mode of client verification.

undertow.listener.redirect-socket=If this listener is supporting non-SSL requests, and a request is received for which a matching <security-constraint> requires SSL transport, undertow will automatically redirect the request to the socket binding port specified here.
undertow.listener.proxy-address-forwarding=Enables  handling of x-forwarded-host header (and other x-forwarded-* headers) and use this header information to set the remote address.

  buffered in order to perform the renegotiation.

undertow.listener.allow-equals-in-cookie-value=If this is true then Undertow will allow non-escaped equals characters in unquoted cookie values. \
  Unquoted cookie values may not contain equals characters. If present the value ends before the equals sign. The remainder of the cookie value will be dropped.

undertow.listener.allow-unescaped-characters-in-url=If this is true Undertow will accept non-encoded characters that are disallowed by the URI specification.

Note that setting this to true can be considered a security risk, as allowing non-standard characters can allow request smuggling attacks in some circumstances.
undertow.listener.receive-buffer=The receive buffer size, in bytes.
undertow.listener.send-buffer=The send buffer size, in bytes.
undertow.listener.max-connections=The maximum number of concurrent connections. Only values greater than 0 are allowed. For unlimited connections simply undefine this attribute value.

undertow.listener.proxy-protocol=If this is true then the listener will use the proxy protocol v1, as defined by https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt. This option MUST only be enabled for listeners that are behind a load balancer that supports the same protocol.
