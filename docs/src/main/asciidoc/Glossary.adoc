== Module

A logical grouping of classes used for classloading and dependency
management in WildFly 10. Modules can be _dynamic_ or _static_.

_Static Modules_ are the predefined modules installed in the modules/
directory of the application server.

_Dynamic Modules_ are created by the application server for each
deployment (or sub-deployment in an EAR).
