Missing ActiveMQ Artemis and Jakarta Messaging?

[WARNING]

WildFly's default configuration provides Jakarta EE Web Profile support and thus
doesn't include Jakarta Messaging (provided by ActiveMQ Artemis). As noted in the 
link:#wildfly-configurations[WildFly Configurations] section, other configuration
profiles do provide all features required by the Jakarta EE Full Platform. If you 
want to use messaging, make sure you 
link:#starting-wildfly-with-an-alternate-configuration[start the server using an alternate configuration]
that provides the Jakarta EE Full Platform.

This document provides a quick overview on how to download and get
started using WildFly {wildflyVersion} for your application development. For in-depth
content on administrative features, refer to the WildFly {wildflyVersion} link:Admin_Guide{outfilesuffix}[Admin Guide].

[[requirements]]
== Requirements

* Java SE 8 or later. We recommend that you use the latest available update
of the current long-term support Java release.


[[installation-options]]
== Installation Options

There are a number of ways you can install WildFly, including unzipping our traditional download zip, provisioning a
custom installation using Galleon, or building a bootable jar. The link:Installation_Guide{outfilesuffix}[Installation Guide]
helps you identify the kind of WildFly installation that best fits your application's deployment needs. In this guide
we'll focus on the common approach of installing the download zip.

[[download]]
=== Download

WildFly {wildflyVersion} distributions can be obtained from:

http://www.wildfly.org/downloads/[wildfly.org/downloads]

WildFly {wildflyVersion} provides a single distribution available in zip or tar file
formats.

* *wildfly-{wildflyVersion}.0.0.Final.zip*
* *wildfly-{wildflyVersion}.0.0.Final.tar.gz*

[[installation]]
=== Installation

Simply extract your chosen download to the directory of your choice. You
can install WildFly {wildflyVersion} on any operating system that supports the zip or
tar formats. Refer to the Release Notes for additional information
related to the release.

[[wildfly---a-quick-tour]]
== WildFly - A Quick Tour

Now that you've downloaded WildFly {wildflyVersion}, the next thing to discuss is the
layout of the distribution and explore the server directory structure,
key configuration files, log files, user deployments and so on. It's
worth familiarizing yourself with the layout so that you'll be able to
find your way around when it comes to deploying your own applications.

[[wildfly-directory-structure]]
=== WildFly Directory Structure

[cols=",",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|DIRECTORY |DESCRIPTION

|appclient |Configuration files, deployment content, and writable areas
used by the application client container run from this installation.

|bin |Start up scripts, start up configuration files and various command
line utilities like elytron-tool, add-user and Java diagnostic report available
for Unix and Windows environments

|bin/client |Contains a client jar for use by non-maven based clients.

|docs/schema |XML schema definition files

|docs/examples/configs |Example configuration files representing
specific use cases

|domain |Configuration files, deployment content, and writable areas
used by the domain mode processes run from this installation.

|modules |WildFly is based on a modular classloading architecture.
The various modules used in the server are stored here.

|standalone |Configuration files, deployment content, and writable areas
used by the single standalone server run from this installation.

|welcome-content |Default Welcome Page content
|=======================================================================

[[standalone-directory-structure]]
==== Standalone Directory Structure

In " *_standalone_* " mode each WildFly {wildflyVersion} server instance is an
independent process (similar to previous JBoss AS versions; e.g., 3, 4,
5, or 6). The configuration files, deployment content and writable areas
used by the single standalone server run from a WildFly installation are
found in the following subdirectories under the top level "standalone"
directory:

[cols=",",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|DIRECTORY |DESCRIPTION

|configuration |Configuration files for the standalone server that runs
off of this installation. All configuration information for the running
server is located here and is the single place for configuration
modifications for the standalone server.

|data |Persistent information written by the server to survive a restart
of the server

|deployments |End user deployment content can be placed in this
directory for automatic detection and deployment of that content into
the server's runtime.NOTE: The server's management API is recommended
for installing deployment content. File system based deployment scanning
capabilities remain for developer convenience.

|lib/ext |Location for installed library jars referenced by applications
using the Extension-List mechanism

|log |standalone server log files

|tmp |location for temporary files written by the server

|tmp/auth |Special location used to exchange authentication tokens with
local clients so they can confirm that they are local to the running AS
process.
|=======================================================================

[[domain-directory-structure]]
==== Domain Directory Structure

A key feature of WildFly {wildflyVersion} is the managing multiple servers from a
single control point. A collection of multiple servers are referred to
as a " *_domain_* ". Domains can span multiple physical (or virtual)
machines with all WildFly instances on a given host under the control of
a Host Controller process. The Host Controllers interact with the Domain
Controller to control the lifecycle of the WildFly instances running on
that host and to assist the Domain Controller in managing them. The
configuration files, deployment content and writeable areas used by
domain mode processes run from a WildFly installation are found in the
following subdirectories under the top level "domain" directory:

[cols=",",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|DIRECTORY |DESCRIPTION

|configuration |Configuration files for the domain and for the Host
Controller and any servers running off of this installation. All
configuration information for the servers managed wtihin the domain is
located here and is the single place for configuration information.

|content |an internal working area for the Host Controller that controls
this installation. This is where it internally stores deployment
content. This directory is not meant to be manipulated by end users.Note
that "domain" mode does not support deploying content based on scanning
a file system.

|lib/ext |Location for installed library jars referenced by applications
using the Extension-List mechanism

|log |Location where the Host Controller process writes its logs. The
Process Controller, a small lightweight process that actually spawns the
other Host Controller process and any Application Server processes also
writes a log here.

|servers |Writable area used by each Application Server instance that
runs from this installation. Each Application Server instance will have
its own subdirectory, created when the server is first started. In each
server's subdirectory there will be the following subdirectories:data --
information written by the server that needs to survive a restart of the
serverlog -- the server's log filestmp -- location for temporary files
written by the server

|tmp |location for temporary files written by the server

|tmp/auth |Special location used to exchange authentication tokens with
local clients so they can confirm that they are local to the running AS
process.
|=======================================================================

[[wildfly-configurations]]

without high availability

Important to note is that the *_domain_* and *_standalone_* modes
determine how the servers are managed not what capabilities they
provide.

[[starting-wildfly-10]]
== Starting WildFly {wildflyVersion}

To start WildFly {wildflyVersion} using the default web profile configuration in "
_standalone_" mode, change directory to $JBOSS_HOME/bin.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
./standalone.sh
----

To start the default web profile configuration using domain management
capabilities,

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
./domain.sh
----

[[starting-wildfly-with-an-alternate-configuration]]
=== Starting WildFly with an Alternate Configuration

If you choose to start your server with one of the other provided
configurations, they can be accessed by passing the --server-config
argument with the server-config file to be used.

To use the Full Platform with clustering capabilities, use the following
syntax from $JBOSS_HOME/bin:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
./standalone.sh --server-config=standalone-full-ha.xml
----

Similarly to start an alternate configuration in _domain_ mode:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
./domain.sh --domain-config=my-domain-configuration.xml
----

Alternatively, you can create your own selecting the additional
subsystems you want to add, remove, or modify.

[[test-your-installation]]
=== Test Your Installation

After executing one of the above commands, you should see output similar
to what's shown below.

----

As with previous WildFly releases, you can point your browser to
*_http://localhost:8080_* (if using the default configured http port)
which brings you to the Welcome Screen:

image:wildfly.png[images/wildfly.png]

From here you can access links to the WildFly community documentation
set, stay up-to-date on the latest project information, have a
discussion in the user forum and access the enhanced web-based
Administration Console. Or, if you uncover a defect while using WildFly,
report an issue to inform us (attached patches will be reviewed). This
landing page is recommended for convenient access to information about
WildFly {wildflyVersion} but can easily be replaced with your own if desired.

[[managing-your-wildfly-10]]
== Managing your WildFly {wildflyVersion}

WildFly {wildflyVersion} offers two administrative mechanisms for managing your
running instance:

* a web-based Administration Console
* a command-line interface

The link:Admin_Guide{outfilesuffix}[Admin Guide] covers the details on managing your WildFly
installation. Here we'll just touch on some of the basics.

=== Authentication

By default WildFly {wildflyVersion} is distributed with security enabled for the
management interfaces. This means that before you connect using the
administration console or remotely using the CLI you will need to add a
new user. This can be achieved simply by using the _add-user.sh_ script
in the bin folder.

After starting the script you will be guided through the process to add
a new user: -

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
./add-user.sh
What type of user do you wish to add?
 a) Management User (mgmt-users.properties)
 b) Application User (application-users.properties)
(a):
----

In this case a new user is being added for the purpose of managing the
servers so select option a.

You will then be prompted to enter the details of the new user being
added: -

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
Enter the details of the new user to add.
Realm (ManagementRealm) :
Username :
Password :
Re-enter Password :
----

It is important to leave the name of the realm as 'ManagementRealm' as
this needs to match the name used in the server's configuration. For the
remaining fields enter the new username, password and password
confirmation.

Users can be associated with arbitrary groups of your choosing, so you will be prompted if you would like 
to do this.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
What groups do you want this user to belong to? (Please enter a comma separated list, or leave blank for none)[  ]:
----

Groups can be useful for simplified administration of things like access permissions, but for simply getting
started, leaving this blank is fine.

Provided there are no errors in the values entered you will then be
asked to confirm that you want to add the user, the user will be written
to the properties files used for authentication and a confirmation
message will be displayed.

The modified time of the properties files are inspected at the time of
authentication and the files reloaded if they have changed. For this
reason you do not need to re-start the server after adding a new user.

Finally, you will be asked whether the account you've added is going to be to used
to identify one WildFly process to another, typically in a WildFly managed domain:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
Is this new user going to be used for one AS process to connect to another AS process? 
e.g. for a slave host controller connecting to the master or for a Remoting connection for server to server Jakarta Enterprise Beans calls.
yes/no?
----

The answer for this should be `no`; the account you are adding here is for use by a human administrator.

[[administration-console]]
=== Administration Console

To access the web-based Administration Console, simply follow the link
from the Welcome Screen. To directly access the Management Console,
point your browser at:

*_http://localhost:9990/console_*

NOTE: port 9990 is the default port configured.

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<management-interfaces>
    <http-interface http-authentication-factory="management-http-authentication">
        <http-upgrade enabled="true" sasl-authentication-factory="management-sasl-authentication"/>
        <socket-binding http="management-http"/>
    </http-interface>
</management-interfaces>
----

If you modify the _management-http_ socket binding in your running
configuration: adjust the above command accordingly. If such
modifications are made, then the link from the Welcome Screen will also
be inaccessible.

////
    TODO https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-5532
If you have not yet added at least one management user an error page
will be displayed asking you to add a new user, after a user has been
added you can click on the 'Try Again' link at the bottom of the error
page to try connecting to the administration console again.
////

[[command-line-interface]]
=== Command-Line Interface

If you prefer to manage your server from the command line (or batching),
the _jboss-cli.sh_ script provides the same capabilities available via
the web-based UI. This script is accessed from $JBOSS_HOME/bin
directory; e.g.,

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$JBOSS_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect
Connected to standalone controller at localhost:9990
----

Notice if no host or port information provided, it will default to
localhost:9990.

When running locally to the WildFly process the CLI will silently
authenticate against the server by exchanging tokens on the file system,
the purpose of this exchange is to verify that the client does have
access to the local file system. If the CLI is connecting to a remote
WildFly installation then you will be prompted to enter the username and
password of a user already added to the realm.

Once connected you can add, modify, remove resources and deploy or
undeploy applications. For a complete list of commands and command
syntax, type *_help_* once connected.

[[deploying-an-application]]
=== Deploying an Application

WildFly provides a number of ways you can deploy your application into the server.
These are covered in detail in the link:Admin_Guide{outfilesuffix}#application-deployment[Admin Guide].

If you are running a standalone WildFly server, the simplest way to deploy
your application is to copy the application archive (war/ear/jar) into the `$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments`
directory in the server installation. The server's `deployment-scanner` subsystem will detect
the new file and deploy it.

[NOTE]

If you are running a WildFly managed domain, the `deployment-scanner` subsystem is not
available so you will need to use the CLI or web console to deploy your application. For more, 
see the link:Admin_Guide{outfilesuffix}#application-deployment[Admin Guide].

[[modifying-the-example-datasource]]
=== Modifying the Example DataSource

As with previous JBoss application server releases, a default data
source, *_ExampleDS_* , is configured using the embedded H2 database for
developer convenience. There are two ways to define datasource
configurations:

1.  as a module
2.  as a deployment

In the provided configurations, H2 is configured as a module. The module
is located in the $JBOSS_HOME/modules/com/h2database/h2 directory. The
H2 datasource configuration is shown below.

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:datasources:1.0">
    <datasources>
        <datasource jndi-name="java:jboss/datasources/ExampleDS" pool-name="ExampleDS">

[[configure-logging-in-wildfly]]
=== Configure Logging in WildFly

WildFly logging can be configured with the web console or the command
line interface. You can get more detail on the link:Admin_Guide{outfilesuffix}#Logging[Logging
Configuration] page.

Turn on debugging for a specific category with the CLI:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
/subsystem=logging/logger=org.jboss.as:add(level=DEBUG)
----

In the example above the `org.jboss.as` log category was configured. Use a different value
for the `logger` key to configure a different log category.

By default the `server.log` is configured to include all levels in its
log output. In the above example we changed the console to also display
debug messages.
