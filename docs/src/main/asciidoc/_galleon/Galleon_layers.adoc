A Galleon layer is a name that identifies a server capability (e.g.: jaxrs, 
ejb, microprofile-config, jpa) or an aggregation of such capabilities. A layer captures a server capability in the form of:

* A piece of server XML configuration (e.g.: extension, configured subsystem, interfaces) that describes the capability.
* A set of modules and other filesystem content that implements the capability.

When you are using a layer, it delivers these pieces of information in order for 
Galleon to assemble a server containing only the required configuration and modules. 

In the tables below we provide basic information about all of the layers WildFly provides.

Besides the layer names and a brief description of each, the tables below detail the various dependency relationships
between layers. If the capabilities provided by a layer A require capabilities provided by another layer B, then layer A will _depend on_ layer B.
If you ask for layer A, then Galleon will automatically provide B as well. In some cases A's dependency on B can be _optional_; that
is A typically comes with B, but can function without it. In this case if you ask for A by default Galleon will provide B as well,
but you can tell Galleon to _exclude_ B.

Some layers are logical _alternatives_ to other layers. If two layers are alternatives to each other they both provide the same general
capabilities, but with different implementation characteristics. For example a number of layers provide the capability to cache different
types of objects. These layers typically come in pairs of alternatives, where one alternative provides local caching, while the other provides
distributed caching.  If a layer you want has an optional dependency on a layer that has an alternative, you can exclude that dependency
and instead specify the alternative. If a layer has an alternative the Description column in the tables below will identify it.

[NOTE]
====
If the elytron layer is present, security will be handled by the elytron subsystem.
The undertow and ejb subsystems are configured with an _other_ _application-security-domain_ that references the Elytron _ApplicationDomain_ security domain.

[[wildfly_foundational_galleon_layers]]
==== Foundational Galleon layers

A single Galleon layer can provide a relatively small set of capabilities, but most users will want to start with a broader set
of capabilities without having to spell out all the details. To help with this WildFly provides a few foundational layers
all of which provide typical core WildFly capabilities like the logging subsystem and a secure remote management interface.

You don't have to base your WildFly installation on one of these foundational layers, but doing so may be more convenient.
