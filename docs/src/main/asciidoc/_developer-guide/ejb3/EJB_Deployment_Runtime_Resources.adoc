[[EJB_Deployment_Runtime_Resources]]
= EJB Deployment Runtime Resources

Enterprise bean deployment exposes certain management runtime resources to help users inspect enterprise bean metadata
and monitor invocation statistics. Bean metadata is configured in the application via deployment descriptor and
annotations. Stateless, stateful, singleton session beans and message-driven beans support a common set of resources,
and also resources specific to the bean type. For example, these are some of the common enterprise bean resources:

* jndi-names
* component-class-name
* declared-roles
* transaction-type
* stateful-timeout
* activation-config

Users can view these enterprise bean resources via WildFly CLI or Administration Console. The following sections
provides sample CLI and Administration Console output for each enterprise bean type. For complete details, refer to
https://wildscribe.github.io/[WildFly Model Reference Documentation]

[[Stateless_Session_Bean_Runtime_Resources]]
