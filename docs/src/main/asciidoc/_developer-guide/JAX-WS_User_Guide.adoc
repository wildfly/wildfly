[[JAX-WS_User_Guide]]
= JAX-WS User Guide

The http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=224[Java API for XML-Based Web
Services (JAX-WS / JSR-224)] defines the mapping between WSDL and Java
as well as the classes to be used for accessing webservices and
publishing them. JBossWS implements the latest JAX-WS specification,
hence users can reference it for any vendor agnostic webservice usage
need. Below is a brief overview of the most basic functionalities.

[[web-service-endpoints]]
== Web Service Endpoints

JAX-WS simplifies the development model for a web service endpoint a
great deal. In short, an endpoint implementation bean is annotated with
JAX-WS annotations and deployed to the server. The server automatically
generates and publishes the abstract contract (i.e. wsdl+schema) for
client consumption. All marshalling/unmarshalling is delegated to
http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=jaxb[JAXB].

[[plain-old-java-object-pojo]]
=== Plain old Java Object (POJO)

Let's take a look at simple POJO endpoint implementation. All endpoint
associated metadata is provided via
http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=181[JSR-181] annotations

....
@WebService
@SOAPBinding(style = SOAPBinding.Style.RPC)
public class JSEBean01
{
   @WebMethod
   public String echo(String input)
   {
      ...
   }
}
....

[[the-endpoint-as-a-web-application]]
==== The endpoint as a web application

A JAX-WS java service endpoint (JSE) is deployed as a web application.
Here is a sample _web.xml_ descriptor:

....
<web-app ...>
  <servlet>
    <servlet-name>TestService</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>org.jboss.test.ws.jaxws.samples.jsr181pojo.JSEBean01</servlet-class>
  </servlet>
  <servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>TestService</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
  </servlet-mapping>
</web-app>
....

[[packaging-the-endpoint]]
==== Packaging the endpoint

A JSR-181 java service endpoint (JSE) is packaged as a web application
in a _war_ file.

....
<war warfile="${build.dir}/libs/jbossws-samples-jsr181pojo.war" webxml="${build.resources.dir}/samples/jsr181pojo/WEB-INF/web.xml">
  <classes dir="${build.dir}/classes">
    <include name="org/jboss/test/ws/samples/jsr181pojo/JSEBean01.class"/>
  </classes>
</war>
....

Note, only the endpoint implementation bean and web.xml are required.

[[accessing-the-generated-wsdl]]
==== Accessing the generated WSDL

A successfully deployed service endpoint will show up in the WildFly
managent console. You can get the deployed endpoint wsdl address there
too.

[IMPORTANT]

Note, it is also possible to generate the abstract contract off line
using JBossWS tools. For details of that please see Bottom-Up (Java to
WSDL).

[[ejb3-stateless-session-bean-slsb]]
=== EJB3 Stateless Session Bean (SLSB)

The JAX-WS programming model supports the same set of annotations on
EJB3 stateless session beans as on POJO endpoints.

....
@Stateless
@Remote(EJB3RemoteInterface.class)
@RemoteBinding(jndiBinding = "/ejb3/EJB3EndpointInterface")

@WebService
@SOAPBinding(style = SOAPBinding.Style.RPC)
public class EJB3Bean01 implements EJB3RemoteInterface
{
   @WebMethod
   public String echo(String input)
   {
      ...
   }
}
....

Above you see an EJB-3.0 stateless session bean that exposes one method
both on the remote interface and as an endpoint operation.

[[packaging-the-endpoint-1]]
==== Packaging the endpoint

A JSR-181 EJB service endpoint is packaged as an ordinary ejb
deployment.

....
<jar jarfile="${build.dir}/libs/jbossws-samples-jsr181ejb.jar">
  <fileset dir="${build.dir}/classes">
    <include name="org/jboss/test/ws/samples/jsr181ejb/EJB3Bean01.class"/>
    <include name="org/jboss/test/ws/samples/jsr181ejb/EJB3RemoteInterface.class"/>
  </fileset>
</jar>
....

[[accessing-the-generated-wsdl-1]]
==== Accessing the generated WSDL

A successfully deployed service endpoint will show up in the WildFly
managent console. You can get the deployed endpoint wsdl address there
too.

[IMPORTANT]

Note, it is also possible to generate the abstract contract off line
using JBossWS tools. For details of that please see Bottom-Up (Java to
WSDL).

[[endpoint-provider]]
=== Endpoint Provider

JAX-WS services typically implement a native Java service endpoint
interface (SEI), perhaps mapped from a WSDL port type, either directly
or via the use of annotations.

Java SEIs provide a high level Java-centric abstraction that hides the
details of converting between Java objects and their XML representations
for use in XML-based messages. However, in some cases it is desirable
for services to be able to operate at the XML message level. The
Provider interface offers an alternative to SEIs and may be implemented
by services wishing to work at the XML message level.

A Provider based service instances invoke method is called for each
message received for the service.

....
@WebServiceProvider(wsdlLocation = "WEB-INF/wsdl/Provider.wsdl")
@ServiceMode(value = Service.Mode.PAYLOAD)
public class ProviderBeanPayload implements Provider<Source>
{
   public Source invoke(Source req)
   {
      // Access the entire request PAYLOAD and return the response PAYLOAD
   }
}
....

Note, `Service.Mode.PAYLOAD` is the default and does not have to be
declared explicitly. You can also use `Service.Mode.MESSAGE` to access
the entire SOAP message (i.e. with `MESSAGE` the Provider can also see
SOAP Headers)

The abstract contract for a provider endpoint cannot be
derived/generated automatically. Therefore it is necessary to specify
the _wsdlLocation_ with the `@` `WebServiceProvider` annotation.

[[web-service-clients]]
== Web Service Clients

[[service]]
=== Service

`Service` is an abstraction that represents a WSDL service. A WSDL
service is a collection of related ports, each of which consists of a
port type bound to a particular protocol and available at a particular
endpoint address.

For most clients, you will start with a set of stubs generated from the
WSDL. One of these will be the service, and you will create objects of
that class in order to work with the service (see "static case" below).

[[service-usage]]
==== Service Usage

[[static-case]]
===== Static case

Most clients will start with a WSDL file, and generate some stubs using
JBossWS tools like _wsconsume_. This usually gives a mass of files, one
of which is the top of the tree. This is the service implementation
class.

The generated implementation class can be recognised as it will have two
public constructors, one with no arguments and one with two arguments,
representing the wsdl location (a `java.net.URL`) and the service name
(a `javax.xml.namespace.QName`) respectively.

Usually you will use the no-argument constructor. In this case the WSDL
location and service name are those found in the WSDL. These are set
implicitly from the `@WebServiceClient` annotation that decorates the
generated class.

The following code snippet shows the generated constructors from the
generated class:

....
// Generated Service Class

@WebServiceClient(name="StockQuoteService", targetNamespace="http://example.com/stocks", wsdlLocation="http://example.com/stocks.wsdl")
public class StockQuoteService extends javax.xml.ws.Service
{
   public StockQuoteService()
   {
      super(new URL("http://example.com/stocks.wsdl"), new QName("http://example.com/stocks", "StockQuoteService"));
   }

   public StockQuoteService(String wsdlLocation, QName serviceName)
   {
      super(wsdlLocation, serviceName);
   }

   ...
}
....

Section Dynamic Proxy explains how to obtain a port from the service and
how to invoke an operation on the port. If you need to work with the XML
payload directly or with the XML representation of the entire SOAP
message, have a look at `Dispatch`.

[[dynamic-case]]
===== Dynamic case

In the dynamic case, when nothing is generated, a web service client
uses `Service.create` to create Service instances, the following code
illustrates this process.

....
URL wsdlLocation = new URL("http://example.org/my.wsdl");
QName serviceName = new QName("http://example.org/sample", "MyService");
Service service = Service.create(wsdlLocation, serviceName);
....

[[handler-resolver]]
==== Handler Resolver

JAX-WS provides a flexible plug-in framework for message processing
modules, known as handlers, that may be used to extend the capabilities
of a JAX-WS runtime system. Handler Framework describes the handler
framework in detail. A Service instance provides access to a
`HandlerResolver` via a pair of `getHandlerResolver` /
`setHandlerResolver` methods that may be used to configure a set of
handlers on a per-service, per-port or per-protocol binding basis.

When a Service instance is used to create a proxy or a Dispatch instance
then the handler resolver currently registered with the service is used
to create the required handler chain. Subsequent changes to the handler
resolver configured for a Service instance do not affect the handlers on
previously created proxies, or Dispatch instances.

[[executor]]
==== Executor

Service instances can be configured with a
`java.util.concurrent.Executor`. The executor will then be used to
invoke any asynchronous callbacks requested by the application. The
`setExecutor` and `getExecutor` methods of `Service` can be used to
modify and retrieve the executor configured for a service.

[[dynamic-proxy]]
=== Dynamic Proxy

You can create an instance of a client proxy using one of `getPort`
methods on the `Service`.

....
/**
 * The getPort method returns a proxy. A service client
 * uses this proxy to invoke operations on the target
 * service endpoint. The <code>serviceEndpointInterface</code>
 * specifies the service endpoint interface that is supported by
 * the created dynamic proxy instance.
 **/
public <T> T getPort(QName portName, Class<T> serviceEndpointInterface)
{
   ...
}

/**
 * The getPort method returns a proxy. The parameter
 * <code>serviceEndpointInterface</code> specifies the service
 * endpoint interface that is supported by the returned proxy.
 * In the implementation of this method, the JAX-WS
 * runtime system takes the responsibility of selecting a protocol
 * binding (and a port) and configuring the proxy accordingly.
 * The returned proxy should not be reconfigured by the client.
 *
 **/
public <T> T getPort(Class<T> serviceEndpointInterface)
{
   ...
}
....

The service endpoint interface (SEI) is usually generated using tools.
For details see Top Down (WSDL to Java)

A generated static Service usually also offers typed methods to get
ports. These methods also return dynamic proxies that implement the SEI.

....
@WebServiceClient(name = "TestEndpointService", targetNamespace = "http://org.jboss.ws/wsref",
   wsdlLocation = "http://localhost.localdomain:8080/jaxws-samples-webserviceref?wsdl")

public class TestEndpointService extends Service
{
    ...

    public TestEndpointService(URL wsdlLocation, QName serviceName) {
        super(wsdlLocation, serviceName);
    }

    @WebEndpoint(name = "TestEndpointPort")
    public TestEndpoint getTestEndpointPort()
    {
        return (TestEndpoint)super.getPort(TESTENDPOINTPORT, TestEndpoint.class);
    }
}
....

[[webserviceref]]
=== WebServiceRef

The `@WebServiceRef` annotation is used to declare a reference to a Web
service. It follows the resource pattern exemplified by the
`javax.annotation.Resource` annotation in
http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=250[JSR-250].

There are two uses to the WebServiceRef annotation:

1.  To define a reference whose type is a generated service class. In
this case, the type and value element will both refer to the generated
service class type. Moreover, if the reference type can be inferred by
the field/method declaration the annotation is applied to, the type and
value elements MAY have the default value (Object.class, that is). If
the type cannot be inferred, then at least the type element MUST be
present with a non-default value.
2.  To define a reference whose type is a SEI. In this case, the type
element MAY be present with its default value if the type of the
reference can be inferred from the annotated field/method declaration,
but the value element MUST always be present and refer to a generated
service class type (a subtype of javax.xml.ws.Service). The wsdlLocation
element, if present, overrides theWSDL location information specified in
the WebService annotation of the referenced generated service class.
+
....
public class EJB3Client implements EJB3Remote
{
   @WebServiceRef
   public TestEndpointService service4;

   @WebServiceRef
   public TestEndpoint port3;
....

[[dispatch]]
=== Dispatch

XMLWeb Services use XML messages for communication between services and
service clients. The higher level JAX-WS APIs are designed to hide the
details of converting between Java method invocations and the
corresponding XML messages, but in some cases operating at the XML
message level is desirable. The Dispatch interface provides support for
this mode of interaction.

`Dispatch` supports two usage modes, identified by the constants
`javax.xml.ws.Service.Mode.MESSAGE` and
`javax.xml.ws.Service.Mode.PAYLOAD` respectively:

*_Message_* In this mode, client applications work directly with
protocol-specific message structures. E.g., when used with a SOAP
protocol binding, a client application would work directly with a SOAP
message.

*_Message Payload_* In this mode, client applications work with the
payload of messages rather than the messages themselves. E.g., when used
with a SOAP protocol binding, a client application would work with the
contents of the SOAP Body rather than the SOAP message as a whole.

Dispatch is a low level API that requires clients to construct messages
or message payloads as XML and requires an intimate knowledge of the
desired message or payload structure. Dispatch is a generic class that
supports input and output of messages or message payloads of any type.

....
Service service = Service.create(wsdlURL, serviceName);
Dispatch dispatch = service.createDispatch(portName, StreamSource.class, Mode.PAYLOAD);

String payload = "<ns1:ping xmlns:ns1='http://oneway.samples.jaxws.ws.test.jboss.org/'/>";
dispatch.invokeOneWay(new StreamSource(new StringReader(payload)));

payload = "<ns1:feedback xmlns:ns1='http://oneway.samples.jaxws.ws.test.jboss.org/'/>";
Source retObj = (Source)dispatch.invoke(new StreamSource(new StringReader(payload)));
....

[[asynchronous-invocations]]
=== Asynchronous Invocations

The `BindingProvider` interface represents a component that provides a
protocol binding for use by clients, it is implemented by proxies and is
extended by the `Dispatch` interface.

`BindingProvider` instances may provide asynchronous operation
capabilities. When used, asynchronous operation invocations are
decoupled from the `BindingProvider` instance at invocation time such
that the response context is not updated when the operation completes.
Instead a separate response context is made available using the
`Response` interface.

....
public void testInvokeAsync() throws Exception
{
   URL wsdlURL = new URL("http://" + getServerHost() + ":8080/jaxws-samples-asynchronous?wsdl");
   QName serviceName = new QName(targetNS, "TestEndpointService");
   Service service = Service.create(wsdlURL, serviceName);
   TestEndpoint port = service.getPort(TestEndpoint.class);
   Response response = port.echoAsync("Async");
   // access future
   String retStr = (String) response.get();
   assertEquals("Async", retStr);
}
....

[[oneway-invocations]]
=== Oneway Invocations

`@Oneway` indicates that the given web method has only an input message
and no output. Typically, a oneway method returns the thread of control
to the calling application prior to executing the actual business
method.

....
@WebService (name="PingEndpoint")
@SOAPBinding(style = SOAPBinding.Style.RPC)
public class PingEndpointImpl
{
   private static String feedback;
  
   @WebMethod
   @Oneway
   publicvoid ping()
   {
      log.info("ping");
      feedback = "ok";
   }
  
   @WebMethod
   public String feedback()
   {
      log.info("feedback");
      return feedback;
   }
}
....

[[timeout-configuration]]
=== Timeout Configuration

There are two properties to configure the http connection timeout and
client receive time out:

....
public void testConfigureTimeout() throws Exception
{
   //Set timeout until a connection is established
   ((BindingProvider)port).getRequestContext().put("javax.xml.ws.client.connectionTimeout", "6000");

   //Set timeout until the response is received
   ((BindingProvider) port).getRequestContext().put("javax.xml.ws.client.receiveTimeout", "1000");

   port.echo("testTimeout");
}
....

[[common-api]]
== Common API

This sections describes concepts that apply equally to Web Service
Endpoints and Web Service Clients.

[[handler-framework]]
=== Handler Framework

The handler framework is implemented by a JAX-WS protocol binding in
both client and server side runtimes. Proxies, and Dispatch instances,
known collectively as binding providers, each use protocol bindings to
bind their abstract functionality to specific protocols.

Client and server-side handlers are organized into an ordered list known
as a handler chain. The handlers within a handler chain are invoked each
time a message is sent or received. Inbound messages are processed by
handlers prior to binding provider processing. Outbound messages are
processed by handlers after any binding provider processing.

Handlers are invoked with a message context that provides methods to
access and modify inbound and outbound messages and to manage a set of
properties. Message context properties may be used to facilitate
communication between individual handlers and between handlers and
client and service implementations. Different types of handlers are
invoked with different types of message context.

[[logical-handler]]
==== Logical Handler

Handlers that only operate on message context properties and message
payloads. Logical handlers are protocol agnostic and are unable to
affect protocol specific parts of a message. Logical handlers are
handlers that implement `javax.xml.ws.handler.LogicalHandler`.

[[protocol-handler]]
==== Protocol Handler

Handlers that operate on message context properties and protocol
specific messages. Protocol handlers are specific to a particular
protocol and may access and change protocol specific aspects of a
message. Protocol handlers are handlers that implement any interface
derived from `javax.xml.ws.handler.Handler` except
`javax.xml.ws.handler.LogicalHandler`.

[[service-endpoint-handlers]]
==== Service endpoint handlers

On the service endpoint, handlers are defined using the `@HandlerChain`
annotation.

....
@WebService
@HandlerChain(file = "jaxws-server-source-handlers.xml")
public class SOAPEndpointSourceImpl
{
   ...
}
....

The location of the handler chain file supports 2 formats

\1. An absolute java.net.URL in externalForm. (ex:
http://myhandlers.foo.com/handlerfile1.xml)

\2. A relative path from the source file or class file. (ex:
bar/handlerfile1.xml)

[[service-client-handlers]]
==== Service client handlers

On the client side, handler can be configured using the `@HandlerChain`
annotation on the SEI or dynamically using the API.

....
Service service = Service.create(wsdlURL, serviceName);
Endpoint port = (Endpoint)service.getPort(Endpoint.class);
     
BindingProvider bindingProvider = (BindingProvider)port;
List<Handler> handlerChain = new ArrayList<Handler>();
handlerChain.add(new LogHandler());
handlerChain.add(new AuthorizationHandler());
handlerChain.add(new RoutingHandler());
bindingProvider.getBinding().setHandlerChain(handlerChain); // important!
....

[[message-context]]
=== Message Context

`MessageContext` is the super interface for all JAX-WS message contexts.
It extends `Map<String,Object>` with additional methods and constants to
manage a set of properties that enable handlers in a handler chain to
share processing related state. For example, a handler may use the put
method to insert a property in the message context that one or more
other handlers in the handler chain may subsequently obtain via the get
method.

Properties are scoped as either APPLICATION or HANDLER. All properties
are available to all handlers for an instance of an MEP on a particular
endpoint. E.g., if a logical handler puts a property in the message
context, that property will also be available to any protocol handlers
in the chain during the execution of an MEP instance. APPLICATION scoped
properties are also made available to client applications (see section
4.2.1) and service endpoint implementations. The defaultscope for a
property is HANDLER.

[[logical-message-context]]
==== Logical Message Context

Logical Handlers are passed a message context of type
`LogicalMessageContext` when invoked. `LogicalMessageContext` extends
`MessageContext` with methods to obtain and modify the message payload,
it does not provide access to the protocol specific aspects of amessage.
A protocol binding defines what component of a message are available via
a logical message context. The SOAP binding defines that a logical
handler deployed in a SOAP binding can access the contents of the SOAP
body but not the SOAP headers whereas the XML/HTTP binding defines that
a logical handler can access the entire XML payload of a message.

[[soap-message-context]]
==== SOAP Message Context

SOAP handlers are passed a `SOAPMessageContext` when invoked.
`SOAPMessageContext` extends `MessageContext` with methods to obtain and
modify the SOAP message payload.

[[fault-handling]]
=== Fault Handling

An implementation may thow a `SOAPFaultException`

....
public void throwSoapFaultException()
{
   SOAPFactory factory = SOAPFactory.newInstance();
   SOAPFault fault = factory.createFault("this is a fault string!", new QName("http://foo", "FooCode"));
   fault.setFaultActor("mr.actor");
   fault.addDetail().addChildElement("test");
   thrownew SOAPFaultException(fault);
}
....

or an application specific user exception

....
public void throwApplicationException() throws UserException
{
   thrownew UserException("validation", 123, "Some validation error");
}
....

[IMPORTANT]

In case of the latter, JBossWS generates the required fault wrapper
beans at runtime if they are not part of the deployment

[[jax-ws-annotations]]
== JAX-WS Annotations

For details, see http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=224[JSR-224 - Java
API for XML-Based Web Services (JAX-WS) 2.2]

[[javax.xml.ws.servicemode]]
=== javax.xml.ws.ServiceMode

The `ServiceMode` annotation is used to specify the mode for a provider
class, i.e. whether a provider wants to have access to protocol message
payloads (e.g. a SOAP body) or the entire protocol messages (e.g. a SOAP
envelope).

[[javax.xml.ws.webfault]]
=== javax.xml.ws.WebFault

The `WebFault` annotation is used when mapping WSDL faults to Java
exceptions, see section 2.5. It is used to capture the name of the fault
element used when marshalling the JAXB type generated from the global
element referenced by the WSDL fault message. It can also be used to
customize the mapping of service specific exceptions to WSDL faults.

[[javax.xml.ws.requestwrapper]]
=== javax.xml.ws.RequestWrapper

The `RequestWrapper` annotation is applied to the methods of an SEI. It
is used to capture the JAXB generated request wrapper bean and the
element name and namespace for marshalling / unmarshalling the bean. The
default value of localName element is the operationName as defined in
`WebMethod` annotation and the default value for the targetNamespace
element is the target namespace of the SEI.When starting from Java, this
annotation is used to resolve overloading conflicts in document literal
mode. Only the className element is required in this case.

[[javax.xml.ws.responsewrapper]]
=== javax.xml.ws.ResponseWrapper

The `ResponseWrapper` annotation is applied to the methods of an SEI. It
is used to capture the JAXB generated response wrapper bean and the
element name and namespace for marshalling / unmarshalling the bean. The
default value of the localName element is the operationName as defined
in the `WebMethod` appended with "Response" and the default value of the
targetNamespace element is the target namespace of the SEI. When
starting from Java, this annotation is used to resolve overloading
conflicts in document literal mode. Only the className element is
required in this case.

[[javax.xml.ws.webserviceclient]]
=== javax.xml.ws.WebServiceClient

The `WebServiceClient` annotation is specified on a generated service
class (see 2.7). It is used to associate a class with a specific Web
service, identify by a URL to a WSDL document and the qualified name of
a wsdl:service element.

[[javax.xml.ws.webendpoint]]
=== javax.xml.ws.WebEndpoint

The `WebEndpoint` annotation is specified on the getPortName() methods
of a generated service class (see 2.7). It is used to associate a get
method with a specific wsdl:port, identified by its local name (a
NCName).

[[javax.xml.ws.webserviceprovider]]
=== javax.xml.ws.WebServiceProvider

The `WebServiceProvider` annotation is specified on classes that
implement a strongly typed `javax.xml.ws.Provider`. It is used to
declare that a class that satisfies the requirements for a provider (see
5.1) does indeed define a Web service endpoint, much like the
`WebService` annotation does for SEI-based endpoints.

The `WebServiceProvider` and `WebService` annotations are mutually
exclusive.

[[javax.xml.ws.bindingtype]]
=== javax.xml.ws.BindingType

The `BindingType` annotation is applied to an endpoint implementation
class. It specifies the binding to use when publishing an endpoint of
this type.

The default binding for an endpoint is the SOAP 1.1/HTTP one.

[[javax.xml.ws.webserviceref]]
=== javax.xml.ws.WebServiceRef

The `WebServiceRef` annotation is used to declare a reference to a Web
service. It follows the resource pattern exemplified by the
`javax.annotation.Resource` annotation in JSR-250 [JBWS:32]. The
`WebServiceRef` annotation is required to be honored when running on the
Java EE 5 platform, where it is subject to the common resource injection
rules described by the platform specification [JBWS:33].

[[javax.xml.ws.webservicerefs]]
=== javax.xml.ws.WebServiceRefs

The `WebServiceRefs` annotation is used to declare multiple references
to Web services on a single class. It is necessary to work around the
limition against specifying repeated annotations of the same type on any
given class, which prevents listing multiple `javax.ws.WebServiceRef`
annotations one after the other. This annotation follows the resource
pattern exemplified by the `javax.annotation.Resources` annotation in
JSR-250.

Since no name and type can be inferred in this case, each
`WebServiceRef` annotation inside a WebServiceRefs MUST contain name and
type elements with non-default values. The `WebServiceRef` annotation is
required to be honored when running on the Java EE 5 platform, where it
is subject to the common resource injection rules described by the
platform specification.

[[javax.xml.ws.action]]
=== javax.xml.ws.Action

The `Action` annotation is applied to the methods of a SEI. It used to
generate the wsa:Action on wsdl:input and wsdl:output of each
wsdl:operation mapped from the annotated methods.

[[javax.xml.ws.faultaction]]
=== javax.xml.ws.FaultAction

The `FaultAction` annotation is used within the `Action` annotation to
generate the wsa:Action element on the wsdl:fault element of each
wsdl:operation mapped from the annotated methods.

[[jsr-181-annotations]]
== JSR-181 Annotations

JSR-181 defines the syntax and semantics of Java Web Service (JWS)
metadata and default values.

For details, see http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=181[JSR 181 - Web
Services Metadata for the Java Platform].

[[javax.jws.webservice]]
=== javax.jws.WebService

Marks a Java class as implementing a Web Service, or a Java interface as
defining a Web Service interface.

[[javax.jws.webmethod]]
=== javax.jws.WebMethod

Customizes a method that is exposed as a Web Service operation.

[[javax.jws.oneway]]
=== javax.jws.OneWay

Indicates that the given web method has only an input message and no
output. Typically, a oneway method returns the thread of control to the
calling application prior to executing the actual business method. A
JSR-181 processor is REQUIRED to report an error if an operation marked
`@Oneway` has a return value, declares any checked exceptions or has any
INOUT or OUT parameters.

[[javax.jws.webparam]]
=== javax.jws.WebParam

Customizes the mapping of an individual parameter to a Web Service
message part and XML element.

[[javax.jws.webresult]]
=== javax.jws.WebResult

Customizes the mapping of the return value to a WSDL part and XML
element.

[[javax.jws.soapbinding]]
=== javax.jws.SOAPBinding

Specifies the mapping of the Web Service onto the SOAP message protocol.

The `SOAPBinding` annotation has a target of `TYPE` and `METHOD`. The
annotation may be placed on a method if and only if the
`SOAPBinding.style` is `DOCUMENT`. Implementations MUST report an error
if the `SOAPBinding` annotation is placed on a method with a
`SOAPBinding.style` of `RPC`. Methods that do not have a `SOAPBinding`
annotation accept the `SOAPBinding` behavior defined on the type.

[[javax.jws.handlerchain]]
=== javax.jws.HandlerChain

The `@HandlerChain` annotation associates the Web Service with an
externally defined handler chain.

It is an error to combine this annotation with the
`@SOAPMessageHandlers` annotation.

The `@HandlerChain` annotation MAY be present on the endpoint interface
and service implementation bean. The service implementation bean's
