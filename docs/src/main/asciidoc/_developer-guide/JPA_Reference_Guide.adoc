[[introduction]]
== Introduction

The WildFly JPA subsystem implements the JPA 2.2 container-managed
requirements. Deploys the persistence unit definitions, the persistence
unit/context annotations and persistence unit/context references in the
deployment descriptor. JPA Applications use the Hibernate (version 5.3)
persistence provider, which is included with WildFly. The JPA subsystem
uses the standard SPI (javax.persistence.spi.PersistenceProvider) to
access the Hibernate persistence provider and some additional extensions
as well.

During application deployment, JPA use is detected (e.g. persistence.xml
or @PersistenceContext/Unit annotations) and injects Hibernate
dependencies into the application deployment. This makes it easy to
deploy JPA applications.

In the remainder of this documentation, "entity manager" refers to an
instance of the _javax.persistence.EntityManager_ class.
https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/overview-summary.html[Javadoc
for the JPA interfaces]and https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338[JPA 2.2
specification].

The index of the Hibernate documentation is at
http://hibernate.org/orm/documentation/5.3/

[[update-your-persistence.xml-for-hibernate]]
== Update your Persistence.xml for Hibernate

The persistence provider class name in Hibernate is
*org.hibernate.jpa.HibernatePersistenceProvider*.

Your persistence.xml can specify:

*<provider>org.hibernate.jpa.HibernatePersistenceProvider</provider>*

Or remove the persistence provider class name from your persistence.xml
(so the default provider will be used).

[[entity-manager]]
== Entity manager

The entity manager (javax.persistence.EntityManager class) is similar to
the Hibernate Session class; applications use it to
create/read/update/delete data (and related operations). Applications
can use application-managed or container-managed entity managers. Keep
in mind that the entity manager is not thread safe, don't share the same
entity manager instance with multiple threads.

Internally, the entity manager, has a persistence context for managing
entities. You can think of the persistence context as being closely
associated with the entity manager.

[[container-managed-entity-manager]]
== Container-managed entity manager

When you inject a container-managed entity managers into an application
variable, it is treated like an (EE container controlled) Java proxy
object, that will be associated with an underlying EntityManager
instance, for each started JTA transaction and is flushed/closed when
the JTA transaction commits. Such that when your application code
invokes EntityManager.anyMethod(), the current JTA transaction is
searched (using persistence unit name as key) for the underlying
EntityManager instance, if not found, a new EntityManager instance is
created and associated with the current JTA transaction, to be reused
for the next EntityManager invocation. Use the @PersistenceContext
annotation, to inject a container-managed entity manager into a
javax.persistence.EntityManager variable.

[[application-managed-entity-manager]]
== Application-managed entity manager

An application-managed entity manager is kept around until the
application closes it. The scope of the application-managed entity
manager is from when the application creates it and lasts until the
application closes it. Use the _@PersistenceUnit_ annotation, to inject
a persistence unit into a _javax.persistence.EntityManagerFactory
variable_. The EntityManagerFactory can return an application-managed
entity manager.

[[persistence-context]]
== Persistence Context

The JPA persistence context contains the entities managed by the entity
manager (via the JPA persistence provider). The underlying entity
manager maintains the persistence context. The persistence context acts
like a first level (transactional) cache for interacting with the
datasource. Loaded entities are placed into the persistence context
before being returned to the application. Entities changes are also
placed into the persistence context (to be saved in the database when
the transaction commits).

[[transaction-scoped-persistence-context]]
== Transaction-scoped Persistence Context

The transaction-scoped persistence context coordinates with the (active)
JTA transaction. When the transaction commits, the persistence context
is flushed to the datasource (entity objects are detached but may still
be referenced by application code). All entity changes that are expected
to be saved to the datasource, must be made during a transaction.
Entities read outside of a transaction will be detached when the entity
manager invocation completes. Example transaction-scoped persistence
context is below.

[source, java]
----
@Stateful  // will use container managed transactions
public class CustomerManager {
  @PersistenceContext(unitName = "customerPU") // default type is PersistenceContextType.TRANSACTION
  EntityManager em;
  public customer createCustomer(String name, String address) {
    Customer customer = new Customer(name, address);
    em.persist(customer);  // persist new Customer when JTA transaction completes (when method ends).
                           // internally:
                           //    1. Look for existing "customerPU" persistence context in active JTA transaction and use if found.
                           //    2. Else create new "customerPU" persistence context (e.g. instance of org.hibernate.ejb.HibernatePersistence)
                           //       and put in current active JTA transaction.
    return customer;       // return Customer entity (will be detached from the persistence context when caller gets control)
  }  // Transaction.commit will be called, Customer entity will be persisted to the database and "customerPU" persistence context closed
----

[[extended-persistence-context]]
== Extended Persistence Context

The (ee container managed) extended persistence context can span
multiple transactions and allows data modifications to be queued up
(without an active JTA transaction), to be applied
during completion of next JTA transaction. The Container-managed extended persistence
context can only be injected into a stateful session bean.

[source, java]
----
@PersistenceContext(type = PersistenceContextType.EXTENDED, unitName = "inventoryPU")
EntityManager em;
----

[[extended-persistence-context-inheritance]]
=== Extended Persistence Context Inheritance

----
JPA 2.2 specification section 7.6.3.1
 
If a stateful session bean instantiates a stateful session bean (executing in the same EJB container instance) which also has such an extended persistence context with the same synchronization type, the extended persistence context of the first stateful session bean is inherited by the second stateful session bean and bound to it, and this rule recursively applies independently of whether transactions are active or not at the point of the creation of the stateful session beans. If the stateful session beans differ in declared synchronization type, the EJBException is thrown by the container.  If the persistence context has been inherited by any stateful session beans, the container does not close the persistence context until all such stateful session beans have been removed or otherwise destroyed.

----

By default, the current stateful session bean being created, will (
*deeply*) inherit the extended persistence context from any stateful
session bean executing in the current Java thread. The *deep*
inheritance of extended persistence context includes walking multiple
levels up the stateful bean call stack (inheriting from parent beans).
The *deep* inheritance of extended persistence context includes sibling
beans. For example, parentA references child beans beanBwithXPC &
beanCwithXPC. Even though parentA doesn't have an extended persistence
context, beanBwithXPC & beanCwithXPC will share the same extended
persistence context.

Some other EE application servers, use *shallow* inheritance, where
stateful session bean only inherit from the parent stateful session bean
(if there is a parent bean). Sibling beans do not share the same
extended persistence context unless their (common) parent bean also has
the same extended persistence context.

Applications can include a (top-level) *jboss-all.xml* deployment
descriptor that specifies either the (default) *DEEP* extended
persistence context inheritance or *SHALLOW*.

The WF/docs/schema/jboss-jpa_1_0.xsd describes the *jboss-jpa*
deployment descriptor that may be included in the *jboss-all.xml*. Below
is an example of using *SHALLOW* extended persistence context
inheritance:

________________________________________________________
<jboss> +
<jboss-jpa xmlns="http://www.jboss.com/xml/ns/javaee"> +
<extended-persistence inheritance="SHALLOW"/> +
</jboss-jpa> +
</jboss>
________________________________________________________

Below is an example of using *DEEP* extended persistence inheritance:

________________________________________________________
<jboss> +
<jboss-jpa xmlns="http://www.jboss.com/xml/ns/javaee"> +
<extended-persistence inheritance="DEEP"/> +
</jboss-jpa> +
</jboss>
________________________________________________________

The AS console/cli can change the *default* extended persistence context
setting (DEEP or SHALLOW). The following cli commands will read the
current JPA settings and enable SHALLOW extended persistence context
inheritance for applications that do not include the *jboss-jpa*
deployment descriptor:

_______________________________________________________________________________
./jboss-cli.sh +
cd subsystem=jpa +
:read-resource +
:write-attribute(name=default-extended-persistence-inheritance,value="SHALLOW")
_______________________________________________________________________________

[[entities]]
== Entities

JPA allows use of your (pojo) plain old Java class to represent a
database table row.

[source, java]
----
@PersistenceContext EntityManager em;
Integer bomPk = getIndexKeyValue();
BillOfMaterials bom = em.find(BillOfMaterials.class, bomPk); // read existing table row into BillOfMaterials class
 
BillOfMaterials createdBom = new BillOfMaterials("...");     // create new entity
em.persist(createdBom);  // createdBom is now managed and will be saved to database when the current JTA transaction completes
----

The entity lifecycle is managed by the underlying persistence provider.

* New (transient): an entity is new if it has just been instantiated
using the new operator, and it is not associated with a persistence
context. It has no persistent representation in the database and no
identifier value has been assigned.
* Managed (persistent): a managed entity instance is an instance with a
persistent identity that is currently associated with a persistence
context.
* Detached: the entity instance is an instance with a persistent
identity that is no longer associated with a persistence context,
usually because the persistence context was closed or the instance was
evicted from the context.
* Removed: a removed entity instance is an instance with a persistent
identity, associated with a persistence context, but scheduled for
removal from the database.

[[deployment]]
== Deployment

The persistence.xml contains the persistence unit configuration (e.g.
datasource name) and as described in the JPA 2.0 spec (section 8.2), the
jar file or directory whose META-INF directory contains the
persistence.xml file is termed the root of the persistence unit. In Java
EE environments, the root of a persistence unit must be one of the
following (quoted directly from the JPA 2.0 specification):

"

* an EJB-JAR file
* the WEB-INF/classes directory of a WAR file
* a jar file in the WEB-INF/lib directory of a WAR file
* a jar file in the EAR library directory
* an application client jar file

The persistence.xml can specify either a JTA datasource or a non-JTA
datasource. The JTA datasource is expected to be used within the EE
environment (even when reading data without an active transaction). If a
datasource is not specified, the default-datasource will instead be used
(must be configured).

NOTE: Java Persistence 1.0 supported use of a jar file in the root of
the EAR as the root of a persistence unit. This use is no longer
supported. Portable applications should use the EAR library directory
for this case instead.

"

Question: Can you have a EAR/META-INF/persistence.xml?

Answer: No, the above may deploy but it could include other archives
also in the EAR, so you may have deployment issues for other reasons.
Better to put the persistence.xml in an EAR/lib/somePuJar.jar.

[[troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting

The *org.jboss.as.jpa* logging can be enabled to get the following
information:

* INFO - when persistence.xml has been parsed, starting of persistence
unit service (per deployed persistence.xml), stopping of persistence
unit service
* DEBUG - informs about entity managers being injected, creating/reusing
transaction scoped entity manager for active transaction
* TRACE - shows how long each entity manager operation took in
milliseconds, application searches for a persistence unit, parsing of
persistence.xml

To enable TRACE, open the as/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml (or
as/domain/configuration/domain.xml) file. Search for *<subsystem
xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:logging:1.0">* and add the *org.jboss.as.jpa*
category. You need to change the console-handler level from *INFO* to
*TRACE*.

[source, java]
----
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:logging:1.0">
     <console-handler name="CONSOLE">
      <level name="TRACE" />
      ...
     </console-handler>
 
     </periodic-rotating-file-handler>
     <logger category="com.arjuna">
        <level name="WARN" />
     </logger>
 
     <logger category="org.jboss.as.jpa">
        <level name="TRACE" />
     </logger>
 
     <logger category="org.apache.tomcat.util.modeler">
        <level name="WARN" />
     </logger>
     ...
----

To see what is going on at the JDBC level, enable *jboss.jdbc.spy* TRACE
and add spy="true" to the datasource.

[source, java]
----
<datasource jndi-name="java:jboss/datasources/..." pool-name="..." enabled="true" spy="true">
<logger category="jboss.jdbc.spy">
  <level name="TRACE"/>
</logger>
----

To troubleshoot issues with the Hibernate second level cache, try
enabling trace for *org.hibernate.SQL + org.hibernate.cache.infinispan +
org.infinispan:*

[source, java]
----
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:logging:1.0">
     <console-handler name="CONSOLE">
      <level name="TRACE" />
      ...
     </console-handler>
 
     </periodic-rotating-file-handler>
     <logger category="com.arjuna">
        <level name="WARN" />
     </logger>
 
     <logger category="org.hibernate.SQL">

[[using-the-infinispan-second-level-cache]]
== Using the Infinispan second level cache

To enable the second level cache with Hibernate, just set the
*hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache* property to true or
set *shared-cache-mode* to one of the following:

  * ENABLE_SELECTIVE
  * DISABLE_SELECTIVE
  * ALL

Infinispan is the cache provider for *JPA applications*, so you don't need to specify
anything in addition. The Infinispan version that is included in
WildFly is expected to work with the Hibernate version that is included
with WildFly. Example persistence.xml settings:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><persistence xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence" version="1.0">
<persistence-unit name="2lc_example_pu">
   <description>example of enabling the second level cache.</description>
   <jta-data-source>java:jboss/datasources/mydatasource</jta-data-source>
   <shared-cache-mode>ENABLE_SELECTIVE</shared-cache-mode>
</persistence-unit>
</persistence>
----

Here is an example of enabling the second level cache for a Hibernate
native API hibernate.cfg.xml file:

[source,xml]
----
<property name="hibernate.cache.region.factory_class" value="org.infinispan.hibernate.cache.v53.InfinispanRegionFactory"/>
<property name="hibernate.cache.infinispan.shared" value="false"/>
<property name="hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache" value="true"/>
----

The Hibernate native API application will also need a MANIFEST.MF:

....
Dependencies: org.infinispan,org.hibernate
....

http://infinispan.org/docs/9.3.x/user_guide/user_guide.html#jpa_hibernate_2l_cache[Infinispan
Hibernate/JPA second level cache provider documentation] contains
advanced configuration information but you should bear in mind that when
Hibernate runs within WildFly {wildflyVersion}, some of those configuration options,
such as region factory, are not needed. Moreover, the application server
providers you with option of selecting a different cache container for
Infinispan via *hibernate.cache.infinispan.container* persistence
property. To reiterate, this property is not mandatory and a default
container is already deployed for by the application server to host the
second level cache.

Here is an example of what the Hibernate cache settings may currently be
in your standalone.xml:

[source,xml]
----
 <cache-container name="hibernate" module="org.infinispan.hibernate-cache">
     <local-cache name="entity">
         <transaction mode="NON_XA"/>
         <object-memory size="10000"/>
         <expiration max-idle="100000"/>
     </local-cache>
     <local-cache name="local-query">
         <object-memory size="10000"/>
         <expiration max-idle="100000"/>
     </local-cache>
     <local-cache name="timestamps"/>
 </cache-container>
----

Below is an example of customizing the "entity", "immutable-entity",
"local-query", "pending-puts", "timestamps" cache configuration may look
like:

[source,xml]
----
 <cache-container name="hibernate" module="org.infinispan.hibernate-cache" default-cache="immutable-entity">
    <local-cache name="entity">
        <transaction mode="NONE"/>
        <eviction max-entries="-1"/>
        <expiration max-idle="120000"/>
    </local-cache>
    <local-cache name="immutable-entity">
        <transaction mode="NONE"/>
        <eviction max-entries="-1"/>
        <expiration max-idle="120000"/>
    </local-cache>
    <local-cache name="local-query">
        <eviction max-entries="-1"/>
        <expiration max-idle="300000"/>
    </local-cache>
    <local-cache name="pending-puts">
        <transaction mode="NONE"/>
        <eviction strategy="NONE"/>
        <expiration max-idle="60000"/>
    </local-cache>
    <local-cache name="timestamps">
        <transaction mode="NONE"/>
        <eviction strategy="NONE"/>
    </local-cache>
</cache-container>
----

Persistence.xml to use the above custom settings:

[source,xml]
----
<properties>
    <property name="hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache" value="true"/>
    <property name="hibernate.cache.use_query_cache" value="true"/>

    <property name="hibernate.cache.infinispan.timestamps.cfg" value="timestamps"/>
    <property name="hibernate.cache.infinispan.pending-puts.cfg" value="pending-puts"/>
</properties>
----

[[using-hibernate-search]]
== Using Hibernate Search

WildFly includes Hibernate Search. If you want to use the bundled version of Hibernate Search, which requires to use the default Hibernate ORM persistence provider, this will be automatically enabled.  Having this enabled means that, provided your application includes any entity which is annotated with *org.hibernate.search.annotations.Indexed*, the module *org.hibernate.search.orm:main* will be made available to your deployment; this will also include the required version of Apache Lucene.

If you do not want this module to be exposed to your deployment, set the persistence property *wildfly.jpa.hibernate.search.module* to either *none* to not automatically inject any Hibernate Search module, or to any other module identifier to inject a different module. For example you could set *wildfly.jpa.hibernate.search.module=org.hibernate.search.orm:5.11.0.Alpha1* to use the experimental version 5.11.0.Alpha1 instead of the provided module; in this case you'll have to download and add the custom modules to the application server as other versions are not included.  When setting *wildfly.jpa.hibernate.search.module=none* you might also opt to include Hibernate Search and its dependencies within your application but we highly recommend the modules approach.

[[packaging-the-hibernate-jpa-persistence-provider-with-your-application]]
== Packaging the Hibernate JPA persistence provider with your application

WildFly allows the packaging of Hibernate persistence provider jars with
the application. The JPA deployer will detect the presence of a
persistence provider in the application and
*jboss.as.jpa.providerModule* needs to be set to *application*.

[source, xml]

[[migrating-from-openjpa]]
== Migrating from OpenJPA

You need to copy the OpenJPA jars (e.g. openjpa-all.jar serp.jar) into
the WildFly modules/org/apache/openjpa/main folder and update
modules/org/apache/openjpa/main/module.xml to include the same jar file
names that you copied in. This will help you get your application that
depends on OpenJPA, to deploy on WildFly.

[[migrating-from-eclipselink]]
== Migrating from EclipseLink

You need to copy the EclipseLink jar (e.g. eclipselink-2.6.0.jar or
eclipselink.jar as in the example below) into the WildFly
modules/org/eclipse/persistence/main folder and update
modules/org/eclipse/persistence/main/module.xml to include the
EclipseLink jar (take care to use the jar name that you copied in). If
you happen to leave the EclipseLink version number in the jar name, the
module.xml should reflect that. This will help you get your application
that depends on EclipseLink, to deploy on WildFly.

[source,xml]
----
 <module xmlns="urn:jboss:module:1.1" name="org.eclipse.persistence">
    <resources>
        <resource-root path="jipijapa-eclipselink-10.0.0.Final.jar"/>

[[native-hibernate-use]]
== Native Hibernate use

Applications that use the Hibernate API directly, can be referred to 
as native Hibernate applications. Native Hibernate applications, can
choose to use the Hibernate jars included with WildFly or they can
package their own copy of the Hibernate jars. Applications that utilize
JPA will automatically have the Hibernate classes injected onto the
application deployment classpath. Meaning that JPA applications, should
expect to use the Hibernate jars included in WildFly.

Example MANIFEST.MF entry to add dependency for Hibernate native
applications:

....
Manifest-Version: 1.0
...
Dependencies: org.hibernate
....

[[injection-of-hibernate-session-and-sessionfactoryinjection-of-hibernate-session-and-sessionfactory]]
== Injection of Hibernate Session and SessionFactory

You can inject a org.hibernate.Session and org.hibernate.SessionFactory
directly, just as you can do with EntityManagers and
EntityManagerFactorys.

[[hibernate-transformer]]
== Hibernate ORM 5.1 native API bytecode transformer
The *Hibernate ORM 5.1 native API bytecode transformer*, can rewrite application bytecode,
to handle APIs that have changed between Hibernate ORM 5.1.x + 5.3.x.  For applications that use the Hibernate ORM 5.1
native APIs, you may either rewrite them for Hibernate ORM 5.3 or use the transformer, to rewrite your application byte-code
during application deployment (only the in-memory copy of your application is rewritten).  If your application is only using the
JPA specification APIs, you do not need to transform your application.

For details on the Hibernate 5.3 native API changes, review the https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/blob/5.2/migration-guide.adoc[ORM 5.2]
+ https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/blob/5.3/migration-guide.adoc[ORM 5.3] migration guides.

The Hibernate ORM 5.1 transformer is already deprecated, meaning it could be removed in the next release.
For this reason, we made it easy to enable the transformer via either a system property or jboss-deployment-structure change.

[[hibernate-properties]]
== Hibernate properties

WildFly automatically sets the following Hibernate properties (if
not already set in persistence unit definition):

[cols=",",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|Property |Purpose

|hibernate.id.new_generator_mappings =true |New applications should let
this default to true, older applications with existing data might need
to set to false (see note below). It really depends on whether your
application uses the @GeneratedValue(AUTO) which will generates new key
values for newly created entities. The application can override this
value (in the persistence.xml).

|hibernate.transaction.jta.platform= instance of
org.hibernate.service.jta.platform.spi.JtaPlatform interface |The
transaction manager, user transaction and transaction synchronization
registry is passed into Hibernate via this class.

|hibernate.ejb.resource_scanner = instance of
org.hibernate.ejb.packaging.Scanner interface |Instance of entity
scanning class is passed in that knows how to use the AS annotation
indexer (for faster deployment).

|hibernate.transaction.manager_lookup_class |This property is removed if
found in the persistence.xml (could conflict with JtaPlatform)

|hibernate.session_factory_name = qualified persistence unit name |Is
set to the application name + persistence unit name (application can
specify a different value but it needs to be unique across all
application deployments on the AS instance).

|hibernate.session_factory_name_is_jndi = false |only set if the
application didn't specify a value for hibernate.session_factory_name.

|hibernate.ejb.entitymanager_factory_name = qualified persistence unit
name |Is set to the application name + persistence unit name
(application can specify a different value but it needs to be unique
across all application deployments on the AS instance).

|hibernate.query.jpaql_strict_compliance=true | 

|hibernate.auto_quote_keyword=false | 

|hibernate.implicit_naming_strategy=org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.ImplicitNamingStrategyJpaCompliantImpl

|hibernate.model.generator_name_as_sequence_name=true |

|hibernate.jpa.compliance.transaction=true |

|hibernate.jpa.compliance.closed=true |

|hibernate.jpa.compliance.query=true |

|hibernate.jpa.compliance.list=true |

|hibernate.jpa.compliance.caching=true |

|hibernate.jpa.compliance.proxy=true |

|hibernate.enable_lazy_load_no_trans=false |

|hibernate.jpa.compliance.global_id_generators=true |

|hibernate.search.index_uninverting_allowed=true |
| 
|=======================================================================

if *hibernate.id.new_generator_mappings* is *true*:

* @GeneratedValue(AUTO) maps to
org.hibernate.id.enhanced.SequenceStyleGenerator
* @GeneratedValue(TABLE) maps to
org.hibernate.id.enhanced.TableGenerator
* @GeneratedValue(SEQUENCE) maps to
org.hibernate.id.enhanced.SequenceStyleGenerator

if *hibernate.id.new_generator_mappings* is *false*:

* @GeneratedValue(AUTO) maps to Hibernate "native"
* @GeneratedValue(TABLE) maps to
org.hibernate.id.MultipleHiLoPerTableGenerator
* @GeneratedValue(SEQUENCE) to Hibernate "seqhilo"

[[persistence-unit-properties]]
== Persistence unit properties

The following properties are supported in the persistence unit
definition (in the persistence.xml file):

[cols=",",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|Property |Purpose

|jboss.as.jpa.providerModule |name of the persistence provider module
(default is org.hibernate). Should be application, if a persistence
provider is packaged with the application. See note below about some
module names that are built in (based on the provider).

|jboss.as.jpa.adapterModule |name of the integration classes that help
WildFly to work with the persistence provider.

|jboss.as.jpa.adapterClass |class name of the integration adapter.

|jboss.as.jpa.managed |set to false to disable container managed JPA
access to the persistence unit. The default is true, which enables
container managed JPA access to the persistence unit. This is typically
set to false for Spring applications.

|jboss.as.jpa.classtransformer |set to false to disable class
transformers for the persistence unit. Set to true, to allow entity
class enhancing/rewriting.

|wildfly.jpa.default-unit |set to true to choose the default persistence
unit in an application. This is useful if you inject a persistence
context without specifying the unitName (@PersistenceContext
EntityManager em) but have multiple persistence units specified in your
persistence.xml.

|wildfly.jpa.twophasebootstrap |persistence providers (like Hibernate
ORM 4.3+ via EntityManagerFactoryBuilder), allow a two phase persistence
unit bootstrap, which improves JPA integration with CDI. Setting the
wildfly.jpa.twophasebootstrap hint to false, disables the two phase
bootstrap (for the persistence unit that contains the hint).

|wildfly.jpa.allowdefaultdatasourceuse |set to false to prevent
persistence unit from using the default data source. Defaults to true.
This is only important for persistence units that do not specify a
datasource.

|jboss.as.jpa.deferdetach |Controls whether transaction scoped
persistence context used in non-JTA transaction thread, will detach
loaded entities after each EntityManager invocation or when the
persistence context is closed (e.g. business method ends). Defaults to
false (entities are cleared after EntityManager invocation) and if set
to true, the detach is deferred until the context is closed.

|wildfly.jpa.hibernate.search.module |Controls which version of
Hibernate Search to include on classpath. Only makes sense when using
Hibernate as JPA implementation. The default is auto; other valid values
are none or a full module identifier to use an alternative version.

|jboss.as.jpa.scopedname |Specify the qualified (application scoped)
persistence unit name to be used. By default, this is internally set to
the application name + persistence unit name. The
hibernate.cache.region_prefix will default to whatever you set
jboss.as.jpa.scopedname to. Make sure you set the
jboss.as.jpa.scopedname value to a value not already in use by other
applications deployed on the same application server instance.

|wildfly.jpa.allowjoinedunsync |If set to true, allows an
SynchronizationType.UNSYNCHRONIZED persistence context that has been
joined to the active JTA transaction, to be propagated into a
SynchronizationType.SYNCHRONIZED persistence context. Otherwise, an
IllegalStateException exception would of been thrown that complains that
an unsychronized persistence context cannot be propagated into a
synchronized persistence context. Defaults to false.

|wildfly.jpa.skipmixedsynctypechecking |Set to true to disable the
throwing of an IllegalStateException exception when propagating an
SynchronizationType.UNSYNCHRONIZED persistence context into a
SynchronizationType.SYNCHRONIZED persistence context. This is a
workaround intended to allow applications that used to incorrectly not
get IllegalStateException exception with extended persistence contexts,
to avoid the IllegalStateException, so they don't have to change their
application right away (for compatibility purposes). This hint may be
deprecated in a future release. See WFLY-7108 for more details. Defaults
to false.
|=======================================================================

[[determine-the-persistence-provider-module]]
== Determine the persistence provider module

As mentioned above, if the *jboss.as.jpa.providerModule* property is not
specified, the provider module name is determined by the *provider* name
specified in the persistence.xml. The mapping is:

[cols=",",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|Provider Name |Module name

|blank |org.hibernate

|org.hibernate.jpa.HibernatePersistenceProvider |org.hibernate

|org.hibernate.ogm.jpa.HibernateOgmPersistence |org.hibernate.ogm

|oracle.toplink.essentials.PersistenceProvider |oracle.toplink

|oracle.toplink.essentials.ejb.cmp3.EntityManagerFactoryProvider
|oracle.toplink

|org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.PersistenceProvider
|org.eclipse.persistence

|org.datanucleus.api.jpa.PersistenceProviderImpl |org.datanucleus

[[binding-entitymanagerfactoryentitymanager-to-jndi]]
== Binding EntityManagerFactory/EntityManager to JNDI

By default WildFly does *not* bind the entity manager factory to JNDI.
However, you can explicitly configure this in the persistence.xml of
your application by setting the `jboss.entity.manager.factory.jndi.name`
`hint. The value of that property should be the JNDI name to which the entity manager factory should be bound.`

`You can also bind a container managed (transaction scoped) entity manager to JNDI as well, }}via hint`
`jboss.entity.manager.jndi.name`\{
`}{{. As a reminder, a transaction scoped entity manager (persistence context), acts as a proxy that always gets an unique underlying entity manager (at the persistence provider level).`

`Here's an example:`
