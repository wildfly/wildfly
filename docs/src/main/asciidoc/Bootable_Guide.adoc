[[wildfly_bootable_JAR_development]]
= WildFly bootable JAR application development

This document details the steps to follow in order to develop a WildFly application
packaged as a bootable JAR. A bootable JAR can be run both on bare-metal and cloud platforms.

Developing an application packaged as a bootable JAR is not different from developing an application for a traditional
WildFly server installation using Maven.
The extra steps required to package your application inside a bootable JAR are handled by the 
https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin[_org.wildfly.plugins:wildfly-jar-maven-plugin_] Maven plugin.

This document contains the minimal information set required to build and run a WildFly bootable JAR. 
Complete information on the Maven plugin usage can be found in the bootable JAR https://docs.wildfly.org/bootablejar/[documentation].

[[wildfly-jar-maven-plugin-pom-configuration]]
== Adding the bootable JAR Maven plugin to your pom file

This is done by adding an extra build step to your application deployment Maven pom.xml file.

The next chapter covers the plugin configuration items that are required to identify the WildFly server version and content.

[[wildfly-jar-maven-plugin-galleon-configuration]]
== Galleon configuration

The Bootable JAR Maven plugin depends on https://docs.wildfly.org/galleon/[Galleon] to construct the WildFly server contained in the JAR file. 

Galleon is configured thanks to the Maven plugin ```<configuration>``` element.

The first required piece of information that Galleon needs is a reference to the WildFly Galleon feature-pack. 
The WildFly Galleon feature-pack is a maven artifact that contains everything needed to dynamically provision a server. 
This feature-pack, as well as the feature-packs on which its depends,
are deployed in public maven repositories. 

When the bootable JAR Maven plugin builds a JAR, WildFly feature-packs are retrieved and 
their content is assembled to create the server contained in the JAR.

Once you have identified a WildFly Galleon feature-pack, you need to select a set of 
link:#wildfly_layers[WildFly Layers] that are used to compose the server.

The set of Galleon layers to include is driven by the needs of the application you are developing.
The list of link:#wildfly_layers[WildFly Layers] provides details on 
the server features that each layer brings. Make sure that the API and server features you are using (eg: Jakarta RESTful Web Services, MicroProfile Config, datasources)
are provided by the layers you are choosing.

If you decide not to specify Galleon layers, a server containing all MicroProfile subsystems is
provisioned. (The server configuration is identical to the ```standalone-microprofile.xml``` configuration
in the traditional WildFly server zip.)

Maven Plugin configuration extract example:

[source,xml]
----
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.wildfly.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>wildfly-jar-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <configuration>
        <feature-pack-location>wildfly@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe)</feature-pack-location> (1)
        <layers>
          <layer>jaxrs-server</layer> (2)
        </layers>
      </configuration>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <goals>
            <goal>package</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
----

(1) In this plugin configuration extract, we are retrieving the latest WildFly Galleon feature-pack installed in the
 ```org.jboss.universe:community-universe``` Galleon universe. In case you would like to provision a specific version of the server,
you would need to specify the server version, for example ```wildfly@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe)#21.0.0.Final```

(2) The link:#gal.jaxrs-server[jaxrs-server layer] and all its dependencies are provisioned.

[NOTE]
====

If your project is using link:WildFly_and_WildFly_Preview{outfilesuffix}[WildFly Preview], the ``feature-pack-location`` to use
is ``wildfly-preview@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe)``.

[[wildfly-jar-maven-plugin-additional-configuration]]
== Additional configuration

The plugin allows you to specify additional configuration items:

* A set of WildFly CLI scripts to execute to fine tune the server configuration. 
* Some extra content to be copied inside the bootable JAR (e.g.: server keystore).

Check https://docs.wildfly.org/bootablejar[this documentation] for more details on how to configure execution of
CLI scripts and to package extra content.

[[wildfly-jar-maven-plugin-build]]
== Packaging your application

Call ``` mvn package```  to package both your application and the bootable JAR in the file ```<project build directory>/<project final name>-bootable.jar```

In order to speed-up the development of your application (avoid rebuilding the JAR each time your application is re-compiled), 
the Maven plugin offers a _development_ mode that allows you to build and start the bootable JAR only once.

Check https://docs.wildfly.org/bootablejar[this documentation] for more details on the _development_ mode.

[[wildfly-jar-maven-plugin-run]]
== Running your application

Call ```java -jar <path to bootable JAR> <arguments>```

In additon, you can use the ```wildfly-jar:run``` and ```wildfly-jar:start``` plugin goals to launch the bootable JAR.

[[wildfly-bootable-jar-arguments]]
=== Bootable JAR arguments

The following arguments can be used when starting the bootable JAR:

|===
|Option |Description

|-b[interface]=<value>
|Set system property jboss.bind.address.<interface> to the given value

|-b=<value>
|Set system property jboss.bind.address to the given value

|-D<name>[=<value>] 
|Set a system property. The system properties are set by the server. They are not set by the bootable JAR JVM.

|--help
|Display help then exit

|--cli-script=<path to CLI script file>
|Path to a CLI script to execute when starting the Bootable JAR

|--deployment=<path to WAR/JAR/EAR file or exploded deployment directory>
|Application to install in the hollow JAR. Adding a deployment to an bootable JAR already containing a deployment is invalid.

|--display-galleon-config
|Display the content of the Galleon configuration used to build this bootable JAR.

|--install-dir=<path to directory to install server in>
|By default a new TEMP directory is created. TEMP directory location is controlled by the Java VM (call to ```Files.createTempDirectory```).

|--properties=<url>
|Load system properties from the given url

|-S<name>[=value]
|Set a security property

|-secmgr
|Activate and install the `WildFlySecurityManager`.

|-u=<value>
|Set system property jboss.default.multicast.address to the given value.

|--version
|Print version and exit.

|===
