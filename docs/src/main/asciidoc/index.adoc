Welcome to the WildFly Documentation. The documentation for WildFly is
split into two categories:

* _Administrator Guides_ for those wanting to understand how to install
and configure the server

* _Developer Guides_ for those wanting to understand how to develop
applications for the server

There is also the http://wildscribe.github.io/[WildFly Model Reference]
that provides information about all subsystem configuration options
generated directly from the management model.

[[administrator-guides]]
== Administrator Guides

* The link:Getting_Started_Guide{outfilesuffix}[Getting Started Guide] shows you
how to install and start the server, how to configure logging, how to
deploy an application, how to deploy a datasource, and how to get
started using the command line interface and web management interface

* The link:Admin_Guide{outfilesuffix}[Admin Guide] provides detailed information
on using the CLI and Web Management interface, how to use the domain
configuration, and shows you how to configure key subsystems

* The link:High_Availability_Guide{outfilesuffix}[High Availability Guide] shows
you how to create a cluster, how configure the web container and EJB
container for clustering, and shows you how to configure load balancing
and failover

[[developer-guides]]
== Developer Guides

* The link:Getting_Started_Developing_Applications_Guide{outfilesuffix}[Getting
Started Developing Applications Guide] shows you how to build Java EE
applications and deploy them to WildFly. The guide starts by showing you
the simplest _helloworld_ application using just Servlet and CDI, and
then adds in JSF, persistence and transactions, EJB, Bean Validation,
RESTful web services and more. Finally, you'll get the opportunity to create
your own skeleton project. Each tutorial is accompanied by a quickstart,
which contains the source code, deployment descriptors and a Maven based
build.

* The link:Developer_Guide{outfilesuffix}[Developer Guide] ( _in progress_) takes
you through every deployment descriptor and every annotation offered by
WildFly.

* The link:JavaEE_Tutorial{outfilesuffix}[JavaEE Tutorial] ( _in progress_)
builds on what you learnt in the
link:Getting_Started_Developing_Applications_Guide{outfilesuffix}[Getting Started
Developing Applications Guide], and shows you how to build a complex
application using Java EE and portable extensions.

* The link:Extending_WildFly{outfilesuffix}[Extending WildFly] guide walks you
through creating a new WildFly subsystem extension, in order to add more
functionality to WildFly, and shows how to test it before plugging it
into WildFly.

* The link:Testsuite{outfilesuffix}[WildFly Testsuite] guide walks you trough testing WildFly

== Security Guide

* The link:WildFly_Elytron_Security{outfilesuffix}[WildFly Elytron Security] guide walks you trough new security layer of of WildFly

== Client Guide

* The link:Client_Guide{outfilesuffix}[WildFly Client Configuration] guide walks you trough new wildfly client and how to use it.
