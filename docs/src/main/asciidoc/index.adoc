Welcome to the WildFly documentation. The documentation for WildFly is
split into multiple categories:

* _Installation Guides_ for those wanting to understand the flexibility 
that WildFly offers when it comes to server installation and application deployment.

* _Administrator Guides_ for those wanting to understand how to install
and configure the server.

* _Developer Guides_ for those wanting to understand how to develop
applications for the server.

* _Model Reference_ for those wanting information about all
of configuration options available via the WildFly management model.

* _Security Guide_ for those wanting to understand how to secure the WildFly server and applications.

* _Client Guide_ for those wanting to understand configuration of WildFly clients.

* _Quickstarts_ for those wanting to jump into code and start using WildFly.

appserver variants produced by the WildFly project: the standard WildFly variant and the early-look tech preview
WildFly Preview variant.
* The link:Installation_Guide{outfilesuffix}[Installation Guide] helps you identify
the kind of WildFly installation that best fits your application's deployment needs:
a WildFly zip installation, a WildFly server provisioned with Galleon or a WildFly bootable JAR.

* The link:Bootable_Guide{outfilesuffix}[Bootable JAR Guide] shows you how to package your application and the WildFly server

applications and deploy them to WildFly. The guide starts by showing you
the simplest _helloworld_ application using just Servlet and Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection, and
then adds in Jakarta Server Faces, persistence and transactions, Jakarta Enterprise Beans, Bean Validation,
RESTful web services and more. Finally, you'll get the opportunity to create
your own skeleton project. Each tutorial is accompanied by a quickstart,
which contains the source code, deployment descriptors and a Maven based
build.

* The link:Developer_Guide{outfilesuffix}[Developer Guide] ( _in progress_) takes
you through every deployment descriptor and every annotation offered by
WildFly.

* The link:JavaEE_Tutorial{outfilesuffix}[JavaEE Tutorial] ( _in progress_)
builds on what you learnt in the
link:Getting_Started_Developing_Applications_Guide{outfilesuffix}[Getting Started
Developing Applications Guide], and shows you how to build a complex
application using Jakarta EE and portable extensions.

* The link:Extending_WildFly{outfilesuffix}[Extending WildFly] guide walks you
through creating a new WildFly subsystem extension, in order to add more
functionality to WildFly, and shows how to test it before plugging it
into WildFly.

* The link:Testsuite{outfilesuffix}[WildFly Testsuite] guide walks you through testing WildFly

== Model Reference

* The link:wildscribe[WildFly model reference^] provides information about all standalone server and managed domain
configuration options, using information generated directly from the WildFly management model.
