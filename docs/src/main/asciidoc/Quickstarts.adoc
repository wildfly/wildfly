WildFly ships with a number of quickstarts that show you how to get
started with a variety of technologies in WildFly. You'll find out how
to write a web application using the latest Jakarta EE technologies like
Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection and Jakarta RESTful Web Services.
How to write client libraries to talk to WildFly using web services, Jakarta Messaging or Jakarta Enterprise Beans. 
How to set up a distributed transaction, and how to recover from a 
transaction failure. And much, much more.
