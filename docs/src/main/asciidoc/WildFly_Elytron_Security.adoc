[[about]]
== About

The WildFly Elytron project is a new security framework brought to
WildFly to provide a single unified security framework across the whole
of the application server. As a single framework it will be usable both
for configuring management access to the server and for applications
deployed to the server, it will also be usable across all process types
so there will be no need to learn a different security framework for
host controllers in a domain compared to configuring a standalone
server.

The project covers these main areas:

* Authentication
* Authorization
* SSL / TLS
* Secure Credential Storage

[[elytron-authentication]]
=== Authentication

One of the fundamental objectives of the project was to ensure that we
can use stronger authentication mechanisms for both HTTP and SASL based
authentication, in both cases the new framework also makes it possible
to bring in new implementations opening up various integration
opportunities with external solutions.

[[elytron-authorization]]
=== Authorization

The architecture of the project makes a very clear distinction between
the raw representation of the identity as returned by a SecurityRealm
from the repository of identities and the final representation as a
SecurityIdentity after roles have been decoded and mapped and
permissions have been mapped.

Custom implementations of the components to perform role decoding and
mapping, and permission mapping can be provided allowing for further
flexibility beyond the default set of components provided by the
project.

[[about-ssl-tls]]
=== SSL / TLS

The project becomes the centralised point within the application server
for configuring SSL related resources meaning they can be configured in
a central location and referenced by resources across the application
server. The centralised configuration also covers advanced options such
as configuration of enabled cipher suites and protocols without this
information needing to be distributed across the management model.

The SSL / TLS implementation also includes an optimisation where it can
be closely tied to authentication allowing for permissions checks to be
performed on establishment of a connection before the first request is
received and the eager construction of a SecurityIdentity eliminating
the need for it to be constructed on a per-request basis.

[[secure-credential-storage]]
=== Secure Credential Storage

The previous vault used for plain text String encryption is replaced
with a newly designed credential store. in addition to the protection it
offers for the credentials stored within it, the store currently
supports storage of clear text credentials.
