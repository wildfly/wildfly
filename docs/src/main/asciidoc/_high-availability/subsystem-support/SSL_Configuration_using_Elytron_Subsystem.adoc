This document provides information how to configure mod_cluster
subsystem to protect communication between mod_cluster and load balancer
using SSL/TLS using link:Elytron_Subsystem.html[Elytron Subsystem].

[[overview]]
== Overview

Elytron subsystem provides a powerful and flexible model to configure
different security aspects for applications and the application server
itself. At its core, Elytron subsystem exposes different capabilities to
the application server in order centralize security related
configuration in a single place and to allow other subsystems to consume
these capabilities. One of the security capabilities exposed by Elytron
subsystem is a Client `ssl-context` that can be used to configure
mod_cluster subsystem to communicate with a load balancer using SSL/TLS.

When protecting the communication between the application server and the
load balancer, you need do define a Client `ssl-context` in order to:

* Define a trust store holding the certificate chain that will be used
to validate load balancer's certificate
* Define a trust manager to perform validations against the load
balancer's certificate

[[defining-a-trust-store-with-the-trusted-certificates]]
== Defining a Trust Store with the Trusted Certificates

To define a trust store in Elytron you can execute the following CLI
command:

[source, java]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=elytron/key-store=default-trust-store:add(type=JKS, relative-to=jboss.server.config.dir, path=application.truststore, credential-reference={clear-text=password})
----

In order to successfully execute the command above you must have a
*application.truststore* file inside your
*JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration* directory. Where the trust store
is protected by a password with a value *password*. The trust store must
contain the certificates associated with the load balancer or a
certificate chain in case the load balancer's certificate is signed by a
CA.

We strongly recommend you to avoid using self-signed certificates with
your load balancer. Ideally, certificates should be signed by a CA and
your trust store should contain a certificate chain representing your
ROOT and Intermediary CAs.

[[defining-a-trust-manager-to-validate-certificates]]
== Defining a Trust Manager To Validate Certificates

To define a trust manager in Elytron you can execute the following CLI
command:

[source, java]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=elytron/trust-managers=default-trust-manager:add(algorithm=PKIX, key-store=default-trust-store)
----

Here we are setting the *default-trust-store* as the source of the
certificates that the application server trusts.

[[defining-a-client-ssl-context-and-configuring-mod_cluster-subsystem]]
== Defining a Client SSL Context and Configuring mod_cluster Subsystem

Finally, you can create the Client SSL Context that is going to be used
by the mod_cluster subsystem when connecting to the load balancer using
SSL/TLS:

[source, java]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=elytron/client-ssl-context=modcluster-client-ssl-context:add(trust-managers=default-trust-manager)
----

Now that the Client `ssl-context` is defined you can configure
mod_cluster subsystem as follows:

[source, java]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=modcluster/mod-cluster-config=configuration:write-attribute(name=ssl-context, value=modcluster-client-ssl-context)
----

Once you execute the last command above, reload the server:

[source, java]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] :reload
----

[[using-a-certificate-revocation-list]]
== Using a Certificate Revocation List

In case you want to validate the load balancer certificate against a
Certificate Revocation List (CRL), you can configure the `trust-manager`
in Elytron subsystem as follows:

[source, java]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=elytron/trust-managers=default-trust-manager:write-attribute(name=certificate-revocation-list.path, value=intermediate.crl.pem)
----

To use a CRL your trust store must contain the certificate chain in
order to check validity of both CRL list and the load balancer`s
certificate.

A different way to configure a CRL is using the _Distribution Points_
embedded in your certificates. For that, you need to configure a
`certificate-revocation-list` as follows:

[source, java]
----
/subsystem=elytron/trust-managers=default-trust-manager:write-attribute(name=certificate-revocation-list)
----
