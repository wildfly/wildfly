== Enabling ranked affinity support in load balancer

Enabling ranked affinity support in the <<distributable-web-subsystem,server>> must be accompanied with a compatible load balancer with ranked affinity support enabled.
When using WildFly as a load balancer ranked routing can be enabled with the following CLI command:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
/subsystem=undertow/configuration=filter/mod-cluster=load-balancer/affinity=ranked:add
----

The default delimiter which delimiters the node routes is '.' which encodes multiple routes as `node1.node2.node3`.
Should the delimiter be required to be different, this is configurable by the `delimiter` attribute of the `affinity` resource.
See the following CLI command:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
/subsystem=undertow/configuration=filter/mod-cluster=load-balancer/affinity=ranked:write-attribute(name=delimiter,value=':')
----
