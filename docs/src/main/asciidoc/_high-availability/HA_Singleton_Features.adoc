= HA Singleton Features

In general, an HA or clustered singleton is a service that exists on
multiple nodes in a cluster, but is active on just a single node at any
given time. If the node providing the service fails or is shut down, a
new singleton provider is chosen and started. Thus, other than a brief
interval when one provider has stopped and another has yet to start, the
service is always running on one node.
