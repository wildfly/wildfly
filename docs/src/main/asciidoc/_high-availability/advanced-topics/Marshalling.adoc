In general, the most effective way to improve the scalability of a system with persistent or distributed state is to reduce the number of bytes needed to be sent over the network or persisted to storage.
Marshalling is the process by which Java objects in heap space are converted to a byte buffer for replication to other JVMs or for persistence to local or shared storage.

WildFly generally supports 2 marshalling mechanisms for use with its clustering modules: JBoss Marshalling and ProtoStream.

[[jboss_marshalling]]
== JBoss Marshalling

https://jbossmarshalling.jboss.org/[JBoss Marshalling] is a serialization library for objects implementing `java.io.Serializable`.

When configured to use JBoss Marshalling, an application can optimize the marshalling of a given object, either through custom JDK serialization logic, or by implementing a custom externalizer.
An externalizer is an implementation of the `org.wildfly.clustering.marshalling.Externalizer` interface, which dictates how a given class should be marshalled.
An externalizer reads/writes the state of an object directly from/to an input/output stream, but also:

. Allows an application to replicate/persist an object that does not implement `java.io.Serializable`
. Eliminates the need to serialize the class descriptor of an object along with its state

e.g.
[source,java]
----
public class MyObjectExternalizer implements org.wildfly.clustering.marshalling.Externalizer<MyObject> {

    @Override
    public Class<MyObject> getTargetClass() {
        return MyObject.class;
    }

    @Override
    public void writeObject(ObjectOutput output, MyObject object) throws IOException {
        // Write object state to stream
    }

    @Override
    public MyObject readObject(ObjectInput input) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
        // Construct and read object state from stream
        return ...;
    }
}
----

Externalizers are dynamically loaded during deployment via the service loader mechanism.
Implementations should be enumerated within a file named:
`/META-INF/services/org.wildfly.clustering.marshalling.Externalizer`

[[protostream]]
== ProtoStream

https://github.com/infinispan/protostream[ProtoStream] is serialization library based on the https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers[Protobuf] data format.
The nature of the Protobuf data format makes it very easy to evolve classes without breaking serialization compatibility.
When compared to JBoss Marshalling, ProtoStream is generally more efficient and generates smaller payloads, especially for objects containing fields that are either optional or have a default value.
Since marshallable classes are explicitly enumerated, ProtoStream is not vulnerable to the same arbitrary code execution exploits that affect JDK serialization.

When configured to use ProtoStream, a web application will need to register ProtoStream marshallers/schemas for *every* application-specific type.
WildFly initializes its ProtoStream marshaller using all instances of `org.infinispan.protostream.SerializationContextInitializer` that are visible to the deployment classpath.
Implementations should be enumerated within a file named:
`/META-INF/services/org.infinispan.protostream.SerializationContextInitializer`

Simple objects can leverage ProtoStream annotations and https://infinispan.org/docs/stable/titles/encoding/encoding.html#adding-protostream-processor_marshalling[auto-generate marshallers and schemas at build time].

e.g.
[source,java]
----
@AutoProtoSchemaBuilder(includeClasses = { Person.class })
public interface PersonInitializer extends SerializationContextInitializer {
}

public class Person {
    @ProtoField(number = 1)
    final String name;
    @ProtoField(number = 2, type = Type.UINT32, defaultValue = "0")
    final int age;
    @ProtoField(number = 3)
    Person parent;
    @ProtoField(number = 4, collectionImplementation = LinkedList.class)
    final List<Person> children;

    @ProtoFactory
    Person(String name, int age, Person parent, List<Person> children) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.parent = parent;
        this.children = children;
    }

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.children = new LinkedList<>();
    }

    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return this.age;
    }

    public Person getParent() {
        return this.parent;
    }

    public List<Person> getChildren() {
        return this.children;
    }

    public void setParent(Person parent) {
        this.parent = parent;
    }

    public void addChild(Person child) {
        this.children.add(child);
    }
}
----

Sufficiently complex objects may require a custom `org.infinispan.protostream.SerializationContextInitializer` implementation to register custom marshaller implementations and schemas.
Refer to the https://infinispan.org/docs/stable/titles/encoding/encoding.html#marshalling_user_types[Infinispan documentation] for details.
