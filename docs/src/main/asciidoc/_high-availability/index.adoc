// EDITING NOTES FOR AUTHORS

// While editing, ensure that each section .adoc file *and* its includes contain only a single level 1 heading.

// Each section is organized as main topic .adoc file and optionally includes in the section's directory if composed of multiple files.

// Included files can start with heading 1 (single =) *but* when being included set an offset at appropriate level, e.g.:
// include::infinispan/Infinispan_Subsystem.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// Check by rendering the guide, e.g.
// $ mvn clean install -f docs/pom.xml
// and ensuring the rendered section numbers match the current static outline.
// $ open docs/target/generated-docs/High_Availability_Guide.html

// While building, also ensure there aren't errors such as broken links as CI does not check this at the moment.
