:smallrye-reactive-messaging-version:    3.4
:eclipse-mp-reactive-messaging-api-version:    2.0
----


Support for https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-reactive-messaging[MicroProfile Reactive Messaging] is
provided as a Tech Preview feature by the _microprofile-reactive-messaging-smallrye_ subsystem.

[[required-extension-microprofile-reactive-messaging-smallrye]]
== Required Extension

This extension is *not* included in the standard configurations included in the WildFly distribution.

You can add the extension to a configuration either by adding
an `<extension module="org.wildfly.extension.microprofile.reactive-messaging-smallrye"/>`
element to the xml or by using the following CLI operation:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /extension=org.wildfly.extension.microprofile.reactive-messaging-smallrye:add
{"outcome" => "success"}

[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=microprofile-reactive-messaging-smallrye:add
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "response-headers" => {
        "operation-requires-reload" => true,
        "process-state" => "reload-required"
    }
}
----

To use this subsystem, you must also enable the <<MicroProfile_Reactive_Streams_Operators_SmallRye, MicroProfile Reactive Streams Operators>> extension and subsystem.

If you provision your own server and include the `microprofile-reactive-messaging` Galleon layer, you will get the required modules, and the extension and subsystem will be added to your configuration.

If you provision the `microprofile-reactive-messaging-kafka` Galleon layer it includes the modules to enable the Kafka connector functionality. The `microprofile-reactive-messaging-kafka` layer includes the `microprofile-reactive-messaging` layer which provides the core MicroProfile Reactive Messaging functionality.

== Specification

WildFly's MicroProfile Reactive Messaging subsystem implements MicroProfile Reactive Messaging {eclipse-mp-reactive-messaging-api-version}, which adds support for asynchronous messaging support based on MicroProfile Reactive Streams Operators.

== Configuration
The `microprofile-reactive-messaging-smallrye` subsystem contains no configurable attributes or resources. For the core MicroProfile Reactive Messaging functionality there is no configuration. For configuration of the <<microprofile-reactive-messaging-smallrye-config-connectors, connectors>> to external brokers MicroProfile Config is used.

=== Activation
The subsystem will scan all deployments to find classes containing methods with the `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming` or `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Outgoing` annotations. If these annotations are found, Reactive Messaging will be enabled for the deployment.

=== Programming model and Limitations
See the spec for more thorough examples, this section just attempts to summarize the highlights.

Version 1.0 of the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging specification introduced the `@Incoming` and `@Outgoing` annotations. They are intended for use in an `@ApplicationScoped` (or `@Dependent`) CDI bean:

[source, java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyBean {
    @Outgoing("in-memory")
    public String generate() {
        return ...; // Do some generation of values
    }

    @Incoming("in-memory")
    public void consume(String value) {
        System.out.println(value);
    }
}
----

Values generated by the `generate()` method will be received by the `consume()` method. In this basic setup where the channel names match, the streams are dealt with in-memory. We'll see how to have them handled by Kafka later on.

In the above example, we are essentially generating values and consuming them with no user-interaction. MicroProfile Reactive Messaging 2.0 introduces a `@Channel` annotation, which can be used to inject a `Publisher` for receiving values sent on streams, and an `Emitter` which can be used to send values to a stream. This makes it easier to send/receive values from code paths resulting from user interaction:

[source, java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyBean {
    @Inject
    @Channel("in-memory")
    Emitter<String> emitter;

    @Inject
    @Channel("in-memory")
    Publisher<String> publisher;

    void send(String value) {
        emitter.send(value);
    }
}
----


In the above example we can now easily send data to the Reactive Messaging streams by calling `Emitter.send()`. Similarly, we can subscribe to the Publisher and receive the data. However, receiving still has a few shortcomings:

* The above example will not work out of the box. When trying to send on the `Emitter`, you will get an error that there are no subscibers (which in turn runs the risk of causing overflow). This can be worked around by creating a subscription on the `Publisher`.
* At present there can only be one subscription on the injected `Publisher`.

The above points means that this `Publisher` is not usable directly as an asynchronous return value for e.g. a Jakarta RESTFul Webservices endpoint. As the Jakarta RESTFul Webservices request is what will create the subscription such a call would need to happen before calling `Emitter.send()`.

If we replace the `Emitter` with the `generate()` method from the original method our example will work. However, if we return the Publisher to more than one Jakarta RESTFul Webservices request, we end up with more than one subscriptions which will not all receive every single value.

User's applications intended to return published values to users via e.g. Jakarta RESTFul Webservices will need to do their own subscriptions and buffering of the data. Care must be taken to not let the cache grow uncontrolled, which could cause OutOfMemoryErrors.

[[microprofile-reactive-messaging-smallrye-config-connectors]]
=== Connectors
MicroProfile Reactive Messaging is designed to be flexible enough to integrate with a wide variety of external messaging systems. This functionality is provided via 'connectors'.

The only included connector at the moment is the Kafka connector.

Connectors are configured using MicroProfile Config. The property keys for the methods have some prefixes mandated by the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging Specification which lists these as:

* `mp.messaging.incoming.[channel-name].[attribute]=[value]`
* `mp.messaging.outgoing.[channel-name].[attribute]=[value]`
* `mp.messaging.connector.[connector-name].[attribute]=[value]`

Essentially `channel-name` is the `@Incoming.value()` or the  `@Outgoing.value()`.

If we have the following pair of methods:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
@Outgoing("to")
public int send() {
    int i = // Randomly generated...
}

@Incoming("from")
public void receive(int i) {
    // Process payload
}
----
Then the property prefixes mandated by the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging specifications are:

* `mp.messaging.incoming.from.` - this would pick out the property as configuration of the `receive()` method.
* `mp.messaging.outgoing.to.` - this would pick out the property as configuration of the `send()` method.

Note that although these prefixes are understood by the subsystem, the full set depends on the connector you want to configure. Different connectors understand different properties.


==== Kafka Connector

An example of a minimal microprofile-config.properties file for Kafka for the example application shown previously:

```
kafka.bootstrap.servers=kafka:9092

mp.messaging.outgoing.to.connector=smallrye-kafka
mp.messaging.outgoing.to.topic=my-topic
mp.messaging.outgoing.to.value.serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.IntegerSerializer

mp.messaging.incoming.from.connector=smallrye-kafka
mp.messaging.incoming.from.topic=my-topic
mp.messaging.incoming.from.value.deserializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.IntegerDeserializer
```

Next we will briefly discuss each of these entries. Remember the `to` channel is on the `send()` method, and the `from` channel is on the `receive()` method.

`kafka.bootstrap.servers=kafka:9092` sets the URL of the Kafka broker to connect to for the whole application. It could also be done for just the `to` channel by setting `mp.messaging.outgoing.to.bootstrap.servers=kafka:9092` instead.

`mp.messaging.outgoing.to.connector=smallrye-kafka` says that we want to use Kafka to back the `to` channel. Note that the value `smallrye-kafka` is SmallRye Reactive Messaging specific, and will only be understood if the Kafka connector is enabled.

`mp.messaging.outgoing.to.topic=my-topic` says that we will send data to the Kafka topic called `my-topic`.

`mp.messaging.outgoing.to.value.serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.IntegerSerializer` tells the connector to use `IntegerSerializer` to serialize the values output by the `send()` method when writing to the topic. Kafka provides serializers for the standard Java types. You may implement your own serializer by writing a class implementing `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serializer` and including it in the deployment.

`mp.messaging.incoming.from.connector=smallrye-kafka` says that we want to use Kafka to back the `from` channel. As above, the value `smallrye-kafka` is SmallRye Reactive Messaging specific.

`mp.messaging.incoming.from.topic=my-topic` says that we will read data from the Kafka topic called `my-topic`.


`mp.messaging.incoming.from.value.deserializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.IntegerDeserializer` tells the connector to use `IntegerDeserializer` to deserialize the values from the topic before calling the `receive()` method. You may implement your own deserializer by writing a class implementing `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Deserializer` and including it in the deployment.

In addition to the above, Apache Kafka, and SmallRye Reactive Messaging's Kafka connector understand a lot more properties. These can be found in the SmallRye Reactive Messaging Kafka connector https://smallrye.io/smallrye-reactive-messaging/smallrye-reactive-messaging/{smallrye-reactive-messaging-version}/kafka/kafka.html[documentation], and in the Apache Kafka documentation for the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#producerconfigs[producers] and the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#consumerconfigs[consumers].

The prefixes discussed above are stripped off before passing the property to Kafka.
