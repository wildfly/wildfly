[[Logging]]
= Logging Configuration

[[overview]]
== Overview

The overall server logging configuration is represented by the logging
subsystem. It consists of four notable parts: `handler` configurations,
`logger`, the `root logger` declarations (aka log categories) and
logging profiles. Each logger does reference a handler (or set of
handlers). Each handler declares the log format and output:

[[attributes]]
== Attributes

The root resource contains two notable attributes
`add-logging-api-dependencies` and `use-deployment-logging-config`.

[[add-logging-api-dependencies]]
=== add-logging-api-dependencies

The `add-logging-api-dependencies` controls whether or not the container
adds
link:Implicit_module_dependencies_for_deployments.html#src-557203_safe-id-SW1wbGljaXRtb2R1bGVkZXBlbmRlbmNpZXNmb3JkZXBsb3ltZW50cy1JbXBsaWNpdG1vZHVsZWRlcGVuZGVuY2llc2ZvcmRlcGxveW1lbnRzLVdoaWNoYXJldGhlaW1wbGljaXRtb2R1bGVkZXBlbmRlbmNpZXMlM0Y[implicit]
logging API dependencies to your deployments. If set to `true`, the
default, all the implicit logging API dependencies are added. If set to
`false` the dependencies are not added to your deployments.

[[use-deployment-logging-config]]
=== use-deployment-logging-config

The `use-deployment-logging-config` controls whether or not your
deployment is scanned for
<<per-deployment-logging,per-deployment
logging>>. If set to `true`, the default,
<<per-deployment-logging,per-deployment
logging>> is enabled. Set to `false` to disable this feature.

[[per-deployment-logging]]
== Per-deployment Logging

Per-deployment logging allows you to add a logging configuration file to
your deployment and have the logging for that deployment configured
according to the configuration file. In an EAR the configuration should
be in the `META-INF` directory. In a WAR or JAR deployment the
configuration file can be in either the `META-INF` or `WEB-INF/classes`
directories.

The following configuration files are allowed:

* logging.properties
* jboss-logging.properties
* log4j.properties
* log4j.xml
* jboss-log4j.xml

You can also disable this functionality by changing the
`use-deployment-logging-config` attribute to `false`.

[[logging-profiles]]
== Logging Profiles

Logging profiles are like additional logging subsystems. Each logging
profile constists of three of the four notable parts listed above:
`handler` configurations, `logger` and the `root logger` declarations.

You can assign a logging profile to a deployment via the deployments
manifest. Add a `Logging-Profile` entry to the `MANIFEST.MF` file with a
value of the logging profile id. For example a logging profile defined
on `/subsystem=logging/logging-profile=ejbs` the MANIFEST.MF would look
like:

....
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Logging-Profile: ejbs
....

A logging profile can be assigned to any number of deployments. Using a
logging profile also allows for runtime changes to the configuration.
This is an advantage over the per-deployment logging configuration as
the redeploy is not required for logging changes to take affect.

[[default-log-file-locations]]
== Default Log File Locations

[[managed-domain]]
=== Managed Domain

In a managed domain two types of log files do exist: Controller and
server logs. The controller components govern the domain as whole. It's
their responsibility to start/stop server instances and execute managed
operations throughout the domain. Server logs contain the logging
information for a particular server instance. They are co-located with
the host the server is running on.

For the sake of simplicity we look at the default setup for managed
domain. In this case, both the domain controller components and the
servers are located on the same host:

[cols=",",options="header"]
|============================================================
|Process |Log File
|Host Controller |./domain/log/host-controller.log
|Process Controller |./domain/log/process-controller.log
|"Server One" |./domain/servers/server-one/log/server.log
|"Server Two" |./domain/servers/server-two/log/server.log
|"Server Three" |./domain/servers/server-three/log/server.log
|============================================================

[[standalone-server]]
=== Standalone Server

The default log files for a standalone server can be found in the log
subdirectory of the distribution:

[cols=",",options="header"]
|===================================
|Process |Log File
|Server |./standalone/log/server.log
|===================================

[[filter-expressions]]
== Filter Expressions

[cols=",,,,",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|Filter Type |Expression |Description |Parameter(s) |Examples

|accept |accept |Accepts all log messages. |None |accept

|deny |deny |enies all log messages. |None |deny

|not |not(filterExpression) |Accepts a filter as an argument and inverts
the returned value. |The expression takes a single filter for it's
argument. |not(match("JBAS"))

|all |all(filterExpressions) |A filter consisting of several filters in
a chain. If any filter find the log message to be unloggable, the
message will not be logged and subsequent filters will not be checked.
|The expression takes a comma delimited list of filters for it's
argument. |all(match("JBAS"), match("WELD"))

|any |any(filterExpressions) |A filter consisting of several filters in
a chain. If any filter fins the log message to be loggable, the message
will be logged and the subsequent filters will not be checked. |The
expression takes a comma delimited list of filters for it's argument.
|any(match("JBAS"), match("WELD"))

|levelChange |levelChange(level) |A filter which modifies the log record
with a new level. |The expression takes a single string based level for
it's argument. |levelChange(WARN)

|levels |levels(levels) |A filter which includes log messages with a
level that is listed in the list of levels. |The expression takes a
comma delimited list of string based levels for it's argument.
|levels(DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)

|levelRange |levelRange([minLevel,maxLevel]) |A filter which logs
records that are within the level range. |The filter expression uses a
"[" to indicate a minimum inclusive level and a "]" to indicate a
maximum inclusive level. Otherwise use "(" or ")" respectively indicate
exclusive. The first argument for the expression is the minimum level
allowed, the second argument is the maximum level allowed. |minimum
level must be less than ERROR and the maximum level must be greater than
DEBUGlevelRange(ERROR, DEBUG) minimum level must be less than or equal
to ERROR and the maximum level must be greater than
DEBUGlevelRange[ERROR, DEBUG) minimum level must be less than or equal
to ERROR and the maximum level must be greater or equal to
INFOlevelRange[ERROR, INFO]

|match |match("pattern") |A regular-expression based filter. The raw
unformatted message is used against the pattern. |The expression takes a
regular expression for it's argument. match("JBAS\d+") |

|substitute |substitute("pattern", "replacement value") |A filter which
replaces the first match to the pattern with the replacement value. |The
first argument for the expression is the pattern the second argument is
the replacement text. |substitute("JBAS", "EAP")

|substituteAll |substituteAll("pattern", "replacement value") |A filter
which replaces all matches of the pattern with the replacement value.
|The first argument for the expression is the pattern the second
argument is the replacement text. |substituteAll("JBAS", "EAP")
|=======================================================================

[[list-log-files-and-reading-log-files]]
== List Log Files and Reading Log Files

Log files can be listed and viewed via management operations. The log
files allowed to be viewed are intentionally limited to files that exist
in the `jboss.server.log.dir` and are associated with a known file
handler. Known file handler types include `file-handler`,
`periodic-rotating-file-handler` and `size-rotating-file-handler`. The
operations are valid in both standalone and domain modes.

[[list-log-files]]
=== List Log Files

The logging subsystem has a `log-file` resource off the subsystem root
resource and off each `logging-profile` resource to list each log file.

.CLI command and output

[source, ruby]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=logging:read-children-names(child-type=log-file)

        "server.log.2014-02-12",
        "server.log.2014-02-13"
    ]
}

[[read-log-file]]
=== Read Log File

The `read-log-file` operation is available on each `log-file` resource.
This operation has 4 optional parameters.

[cols=",",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Description

|encoding |the encoding the file should be read in

|lines |the number of lines from the file. A value of -1 indicates all
lines should be read.

|skip |the number of lines to skip before reading.

|tail |true to read from the end of the file up or false to read top
down.

[[faq]]
== FAQ

[[why-is-there-a-logging.properties-file]]
=== Why is there a logging.properties file?

You may have noticed that there is a `logging.properties` file in the
configuration directory. This is logging configuration is used when the
server boots up until the logging subsystem kicks in. If the logging
subsystem is not included in your configuration, then this would act as
the logging configuration for the entire server.

[TIP]

The `logging.properties` file is overwritten at boot and with each
change to the logging subsystem. Any changes made to the file are not
persisted. Any changes made to the XML configuration or via management
operations will be persisted to the `logging.properties` file and used
on the next boot.
