[[Naming_Remote_JNDI_Configuration]]
= Remote JNDI Configuration

The Naming subsystem configuration may be used to (de)activate the
remote JNDI interface, which allows clients to lookup entries present in
a remote WildFly instance.

[NOTE]

Only entries within the `java:jboss/exported` context are accessible
over remote JNDI.

In the subsystem's XML configuration, remote JNDI access bindings are
configured through the `<remote-naming />` XML element:

[source, xml]
----
<remote-naming />
----

Management clients, such as the WildFly CLI, may be used to add/remove
the remote JNDI interface. An example to `add` and `remove` the one in
the XML example above:

[source, ruby]
----
/subsystem=naming/service=remote-naming:add
/subsystem=naming/service=remote-naming:remove
----
