The ability to secure applications using https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html[OpenID Connect] is
provided by the _elytron-oidc-client_ subsystem.

[[subsystem-configuration-elytron-oidc-client]]
== Subsystem

The _elytron-oidc-client_ subsystem is included in the default configuration. If not present, the subsystem can be
added using the following CLI commands.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /extension=org.wildfly.extension.elytron-oidc-client:add

[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=elytron-oidc-client:add

[standalone@localhost:9990 /] reload
----

== Configuration

By default, the _elytron-oidc-client_ subsystem does not contain any configured resources or attributes.

The configuration required to secure an application with OpenID Connect can either be provided within the
application itself or within the _elytron-oidc-client_ subsystem.

=== Deployment Configuration

The configuration required to secure an application with OpenID Connect can be specified in the deployment.

The first step is to create an `oidc.json` configuration file in the `WEB-INF` directory of the application.
The second step is to set the `auth-method` to `OIDC` in the application's `web.xml` file.

Here is an example of an `oidc.json` configuration file:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
{
  "client-id" : "customer-portal",
  "provider-url" : "http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/demo",
  "ssl-required" : "external",
  "use-resource-role-mappings" : false,
  "enable-cors" : true,
  "cors-max-age" : 1000,
  "cors-allowed-methods" : "POST, PUT, DELETE, GET",
  "cors-exposed-headers" : "WWW-Authenticate, My-custom-exposed-Header",
  "enable-basic-auth" : false,
  "expose-token" : true,
  "verify-token-audience" : true,
   "credentials" : {
      "secret" : "234234-234234-234234"
   },

   "connection-pool-size" : 20,
   "socket-timeout-millis": 5000,
   "connection-timeout-millis": 6000,
   "connection-ttl-millis": 500,
   "disable-trust-manager": false,
   "allow-any-hostname" : false,
   "truststore" : "path/to/truststore.pkcs12",
   "truststore-password" : "geheim",
   "client-keystore" : "path/to/client-keystore.pkcs12",
   "client-keystore-password" : "geheim",
   "client-key-password" : "geheim",
   "token-minimum-time-to-live" : 10,
   "min-time-between-jwks-requests" : 10,
   "public-key-cache-ttl": 86400,
   "redirect-rewrite-rules" : {
   "^/wsmain/api/(.*)$" : "/api/$1"
   }
}
----

=== Subsystem Configuration

Instead of adding configuration to your deployment to secure it with OpenID Connect as described in the
previous section, another option is to add configuration to the _elytron-oidc-client_ subsystem instead.

The following example shows how to add configuration to the _elytron-oidc-client_ subsystem.

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<subsystem xmlns="urn:wildfly:elytron-oidc-client:1.0">
    <secure-deployment name="DEPLOYMENT_RUNTIME_NAME.war">
        <client-id>customer-portal</client-id>
        <provider-url>http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/demo</provider-url>
        <ssl-required>external</ssl-required>
        <credential name="secret" secret="0aa31d98-e0aa-404c-b6e0-e771dba1e798" />
    </secure-deployment>
</subsystem>
----

The `secure-deployment` resource allows you to provide configuration for a specific deployment. In
the example above, the `secure-deployment` resource is providing the configuration that should be used
for the `DEPLOYMENT_RUNTIME_NAME.war` deployment, where `DEPLOYMENT_RUNTIME_NAME` corresponds to
the `runtime-name` for the deployment.

The various configuration options that can be specified in the `secure-deployment` configuration
correspond to the same options that can be specified in the `oidc.json` configuration that was
explained in the previous section.

If you have multiple applications that are being secured using the same OpenID provider,
the `provider` configuration can be defined separately as shown in the example below:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<subsystem xmlns="urn:wildfly:elytron-oidc-client:1.0">
    <provider name="keycloak">
        <provider-url>http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/demo</provider-url>
        <ssl-required>external</ssl-required>
    </realm>
    <secure-deployment name="customer-portal.war">
        <provider>keycloak</provider>
        <client-id>customer-portal</client-id>
        <credential name="secret" secret="0aa31d98-e0aa-404c-b6e0-e771dba1e798" />
    </secure-deployment>
    <secure-deployment name="product-portal.war">
        <provider>keycloak</provider>
        <client-id>product-portal</client-id>
        <credential name="secret" secret="0aa31d98-e0aa-404c-b6e0-e771dba1e798" />
    </secure-deployment>
</subsystem>
----

=== Activation

The _elytron-oidc-client_ subsystem will scan deployments to detect if the `OIDC` authentication mechanism
is required for any web components (i.e., for each deployment, the subsystem will determine if OIDC configuration
has either been found within the deployment or if there is OIDC configuration for the deployment in the subsystem
configuration). If the subsystem detects that the `OIDC` mechanism is indeed required, the subsystem will
activate the authentication mechanism automatically. Otherwise, no activation will occur and deployment
will continue normally.

== Virtual Security

The purpose of using OpenID Connect is to verify a user's identity based on the authentication that's been
performed by the OpenID provider. For this reason, OpenID Connect deployments do not depend on `security-domain`
resources that have been defined in the Elytron subsystem, like traditional deployments do. Instead,
the _elytron-oidc-client_ subsystem will automatically create and make use of its own virtual security domain
across the deployment. No further managed configuration is required.

[NOTE]
====
To propagate an identity from a virtual security domain, additional configuration might be required
depending on your use case. See <<identity_propagation, Identity Propagation>> for more details.
====

== OpenID Providers

The `provider-url` attribute in the `oidc.json` configuration and in the _elytron-oidc-client_
subsystem configuration allows you to specify the URL for the OpenID provider that you'd like to use.
For WildFly 25, the _elytron-oidc-client_ subsystem has been tested with the Keycloak OpenID provider.
Other OpenID providers haven't been extensively tested yet so the use of other OpenID providers should
be considered experimental for now and should not be used in a production environment yet. Proper support
for other OpenID providers will be added in a future WildFly release.

== Multi-Tenancy Support

In some cases, it might be desirable to secure an application using multiple `oidc.json` configuration files.
For example, you might want a different `oidc.json` file to be used depending on the request in order to authenticate
users from multiple Keycloak realms. The _elytron-oidc-client_ subsystem makes it possible to use a custom configuration
resolver so you can define which configuration file to use for each request.

To make use of the multi-tenancy feature, you need to create a class that implements the
`org.wildfly.security.http.oidc.OidcClientConfigurationResolver` interface, as shown in the example below:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
package example;

import java.io.InputStream;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;

import org.wildfly.security.http.oidc.OidcClientConfiguration;
import org.wildfly.security.http.oidc.OidcClientConfigurationBuilder;
import org.wildfly.security.http.oidc.OidcClientConfigurationResolver;
import org.wildfly.security.http.oidc.OidcHttpFacade;

public class MyCustomConfigResolver implements OidcClientConfigurationResolver {

    private final Map<String, OidcClientConfiguration> cache = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    @Override
    public OidcClientConfiguration resolve(OidcHttpFacade.Request request) {
        String path = request.getURI();
        String realm = ... // determine which Keycloak realm to use based on the request path
        OidcClientConfiguration clientConfiguration = cache.get(realm);
        if (clientConfiguration == null) {
            InputStream is = getClass().getResourceAsStream("/oidc-" + realm + ".json"); // config to use based on the realm
            clientConfiguration = OidcClientConfigurationBuilder.build(is);
            cache.put(realm, clientConfiguration);
        }
        return clientConfiguration;
    }

}
----

Once you've created your `OidcClientConfigurationResolver `, you can specify that you want to make
use of your custom configuration resolver by setting the `oidc.config.resolver` `context-param` in
your application's `web.xml` file, as shown in the example below:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<web-app>
    ...
    <context-param>
        <param-name>oidc.config.resolver</param-name>
        <param-value>example.MyCustomConfigResolver</param-value>
    </context-param>
    ...
</web-app>
----

[[identity_propagation]]
== Identity Propagation

When securing an application with OpenID Connect, the `elytron-oidc-client` subsystem will automatically
create a virtual security domain for you. If your application invokes an EJB, additional configuration
might be required to propagate the security identity from the virtual security domain depending on how
the EJB is being secured.

=== Securing an EJB using a different security domain

If your application secured with OpenID Connect invokes an EJB within the same deployment (e.g.,
within the same WAR or EAR) or invokes an EJB in a separate deployment (e.g., across EARs)
and you'd like to secure the EJB using a different security domain from your servlet,
additional configuration will be needed to outflow the security identities established by
the virtual security domain to another security domain.

The `virtual-security-domain` resource allows you to specify that security identities
established by a virtual security domain should automatically be outflowed to other
security domains. A `virtual-security-domain` resource has a few attributes, as
described below:

* `name` - This is the runtime name of a deployment associated with a virtual security domain (e.g.,
`DEPLOYMENT_NAME.ear`, a deployment that has a subdeployment that is secured using OpenID Connect).

* `outflow-security-domains` - This is the list of `security-domains` that security identities from
the virtual security domain should be automatically outflowed to.

* `outflow-anonymous` - When outflowing to a security domain, if outflow is not possible, should the
anonymous identity be used? Outflow to a security domain might not be possible if the domain does
not trust this domain or if the identity being outflowed to a domain does not exist in that domain.
Outflowing anonymous has the effect of clearing any identity already established for that domain.
This attribute defaults to `false`.

In addition to configuring a `virtual-security-domain` resource, you'll also need to update the
`security-domain` configuration for your EJB to indicate that it should trust security identities established
by the `virtual-security-domain`. This can be specified by configuring the `trusted-virtual-security-domains`
attribute for a `security-domain` (e.g., setting the `trusted-virtual-security-domains` attribute to
`DEPLOYMENT_NAME.ear` for a `security-domain` would indicate that this `security-domain`
should trust the virtual security domain associated with the `DEPLOYMENT_NAME.ear` deployment).

The `virtual-security-domain` configuration and `trusted-virtual-security-domains` configuration
will allow security identities established by a virtual security domain to be successfully
outflowed to a `security-domain` being used to secure the EJB.

=== Securing an EJB using the same virtual security domain

==== Within the same deployment

If your application secured with OpenID Connect invokes an EJB within the same deployment (e.g.,
within the same WAR or EAR), and you'd like to secure the EJB using the same virtual security
domain as your servlet, no additional configuration is required. This means that if no security
domain configuration has been explicitly specified for the EJB, the virtual security domain will
automatically be used to secure the EJB.

==== Across deployments

If your application secured with OpenID Connect invokes an EJB in a separate deployment (e.g., across EARs)
and you'd like to secure the EJB using the same virtual security domain as your servlet,
additional configuration will be needed. In particular, the EJB will need to reference the virtual
security domain explicitly.

The `virtual-security-domain` resource allows you to reference the virtual security domain
from the security domain configuration for the EJB. As an example, a `virtual-security-domain`
resource could be added as follows:

`/subsystem=elytron/virtual-security-domain=DEPLOYMENT_NAME.ear:add()`

An annotation like `@SecurityDomain(DEPLOYMENT_NAME.ear)` can then be added to the EJB,
where `DEPLOYMENT_NAME.ear` is a reference to the `virtual-security-domain` defined above.

This configuration indicates that the virtual security domain associated with `DEPLOYMENT_NAME.ear`
should be used to secure the EJB.
