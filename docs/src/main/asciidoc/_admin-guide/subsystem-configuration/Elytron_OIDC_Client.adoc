[[Elytron_OIDC_Client]]
= Elytron OpenID Connect Client Subsystem Configuration

The ability to secure applications using https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html[OpenID Connect] is
provided by the _elytron-oidc-client_ subsystem.

[[subsystem-configuration-elytron-oidc-client]]
== Subsystem

The _elytron-oidc-client_ subsystem is included in the default configuration. If not present, the subsystem can be
added using the following CLI commands.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /extension=org.wildfly.extension.elytron-oidc-client:add

[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=elytron-oidc-client:add

[standalone@localhost:9990 /] reload
----

== Configuration

By default, the _elytron-oidc-client_ subsystem does not contain any configured resources or attributes.

The configuration required to secure an application with OpenID Connect can either be provided within the
application itself or within the _elytron-oidc-client_ subsystem.

=== Deployment Configuration

The configuration required to secure an application with OpenID Connect can be specified in the deployment.

The first step is to create an `oidc.json` configuration file in the `WEB-INF` directory of the application.
The second step is to set the `auth-method` to `OIDC` in the application's `web.xml` file.

Here is an example of an `oidc.json` configuration file:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
{
  "client-id" : "customer-portal",
  "provider-url" : "http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/demo",
  "ssl-required" : "external",
  "use-realm-role-mappings" : true,
  "use-resource-role-mappings" : false,
  "enable-cors" : true,
  "cors-max-age" : 1000,
  "cors-allowed-methods" : "POST, PUT, DELETE, GET",
  "cors-exposed-headers" : "WWW-Authenticate, My-custom-exposed-Header",
  "enable-basic-auth" : false,
  "expose-token" : true,
  "verify-token-audience" : true,
   "credentials" : {
      "secret" : "234234-234234-234234"
   },

   "connection-pool-size" : 20,
   "socket-timeout-millis": 5000,
   "connection-timeout-millis": 6000,
   "connection-ttl-millis": 500,
   "disable-trust-manager": false,
   "allow-any-hostname" : false,
   "truststore" : "path/to/truststore.jks",
   "truststore-password" : "geheim",
   "client-keystore" : "path/to/client-keystore.jks",
   "client-keystore-password" : "geheim",
   "client-key-password" : "geheim",
   "token-minimum-time-to-live" : 10,
   "min-time-between-jwks-requests" : 10,
   "public-key-cache-ttl": 86400,
   "redirect-rewrite-rules" : {
   "^/wsmaster/api/(.*)$" : "/api/$1"
   }
}

=== Subsystem Configuration

Instead of adding configuration to your deployment to secure it with OpenID Connect as described in the
previous section, another option is to add configuration to the _elytron-oidc-client_ subsystem instead.

The following example shows how to add configuration to the _elytron-oidc-client_ subsystem.

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<subsystem xmlns="urn:wildfly:elytron-oidc-client:1.0">
    <secure-deployment name="DEPLOYMENT_RUNTIME_NAME.war">
        <client-id>customer-portal</client-id>
        <provider-url>http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/demo</provider-url>
        <ssl-required>external</ssl-required>
        <credential name="secret" secret="0aa31d98-e0aa-404c-b6e0-e771dba1e798" />
    </secure-deployment
</subsystem>
----

The `secure-deployment` resource allows you to provide configuration for a specific deployment. In
the example above, the `secure-deployment` resource is providing the configuration that should be used
for the `DEPLOYMENT_RUNTIME_NAME.war` deployment, where `DEPLOYMENT_RUNTIME_NAME` corresponds to
the `runtime-name` for the deployment.

The various configuration options that can be specified in the `secure-deployment` configuration
correspond to the same options that can be specified in the `oidc.json` configuration that was
explained in the previous section.

If you have multiple applications that are being secured using the same OpenID provider,
the `provider` configuration can be defined separately as shown in the example below:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<subsystem xmlns="urn:wildfly:elytron-oidc-client:1.0">
    <provider name="keycloak">
        <provider-url>http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/demo</provider-url>
        <ssl-required>external</ssl-required>
    </realm>
    <secure-deployment name="customer-portal.war">
        <provider>keycloak</provider>
        <client-id>customer-portal</client-id>
        <credential name="secret" secret="0aa31d98-e0aa-404c-b6e0-e771dba1e798" />
    </secure-deployment>
    <secure-deployment name="product-portal.war">
        <provider>keycloak</provider>
        <client-id>product-portal</client-id>
        <credential name="secret" secret="0aa31d98-e0aa-404c-b6e0-e771dba1e798" />
    </secure-deployment>
</subsystem>
----

=== Activation

The _elytron-oidc-client_ subsystem will scan deployments to detect if the `OIDC` authentication mechanism
is required for any web components (i.e., for each deployment, the subsystem will determine if OIDC configuration
has either been found within the deployment or if there is OIDC configuration for the deployment in the subsystem
configuration). If the subsystem detects that the `OIDC` mechanism is indeed required, the subsystem will
activate the authentication mechanism automatically. Otherwise, no activation will occur and deployment
will continue normally.

== Virtual Security

The purpose of using OpenID Connect is to verify a user's identity based on the authentication that's been
performed by the OpenID provider. For this reason, OpenID Connect deployments do not depend on `security-domain`
resources that have been defined in the Elytron subsystem, like traditional deployments do. Instead,
the _elytron-oidc-client_ subsystem will automatically create and make use of its own virtual security domain
across the deployment. No further managed configuration is required.

== OpenID Providers

The `provider-url` attribute in the `oidc.json` configuration and in the _elytron-oidc-client_
subsystem configuration allows you to specify the URL for the OpenID provider that you'd like to use.
For WildFly 25, the _elytron-oidc-client_ subsystem has been tested with the Keycloak OpenID provider.
Other OpenID providers haven't been extensively tested yet so the use of other OpenID providers should
be considered experimental for now and should not be used in a production environment yet. Proper support
for other OpenID providers will be added in a future WildFly release.

== Multi-Tenancy Support

In some cases, it might be desirable to secure an application using multiple `oidc.json` configuration files.
For example, you might want a different `oidc.json` file to be used depending on the request in order to authenticate
users from multiple Keycloak realms. The _elytron-oidc-client_ subsystem makes it possible to use a custom configuration
resolver so you can define which configuration file to use for each request.

To make use of the multi-tenancy feature, you need to create a class that implements the
`org.wildfly.security.http.oidc.OidcClientConfigurationResolver` interface, as shown in the example below:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
package example;

import java.io.InputStream;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;

import org.wildfly.security.http.oidc.OidcClientConfiguration;
import org.wildfly.security.http.oidc.OidcClientConfigurationBuilder;
import org.wildfly.security.http.oidc.OidcClientConfigurationResolver;
import org.wildfly.security.http.oidc.OidcHttpFacade;

public class MyCustomConfigResolver implements OidcClientConfigurationResolver {

    private final Map<String, OidcClientConfiguration> cache = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    @Override
    public OidcClientConfiguration resolve(OidcHttpFacade.Request request) {
        String path = request.getURI();
        String realm = ... // determine which Keycloak realm to use based on the request path
        OidcClientConfiguration clientConfiguration = cache.get(realm);
        if (clientConfiguration == null) {
            InputStream is = getClass().getResourceAsStream("/oidc-" + realm + ".json"); // config to use based on the realm
            clientConfiguration = OidcClientConfigurationBuilder.build(is);
            cache.put(realm, clientConfiguration);
        }
        return clientConfiguration;
    }

}
----

Once you've created your `OidcClientConfigurationResolver `, you can specify that you want to make
use of your custom configuration resolver by setting the `oidc.config.resolver` `context-param` in
your application's `web.xml` file, as shown in the example below:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<web-app>
    ...
    <context-param>
        <param-name>oidc.config.resolver</param-name>
        <param-value>example.MyCustomConfigResolver</param-value>
    </context-param>
    ...
</web-app>
