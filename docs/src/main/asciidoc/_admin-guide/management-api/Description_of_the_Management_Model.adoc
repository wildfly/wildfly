A detailed description of the resources, attributes and operations that
make up the management model provided by an individual WildFly instance
or by any Domain Controller or slave Host Controller process can be
queried using the `read-resource-description`, `read-operation-names`,
`read-operation-description` and `read-child-types` operations described
in the <<Global_operations,Global operations>> section. In this
section we provide details on what's included in those descriptions.

[[description-of-the-wildfly-managed-resources]]
== Description of the WildFly Managed Resources

All portions of the management model exposed by WildFly are addressable
via an ordered list of key/value pairs. For each addressable
<<management-resources, Management Resource>>, the following
descriptive information will be available:

* `description` – String – text description of this portion of the model
* `min-occurs` – int, either 0 or 1 – Minimum number of resources of
this type that must exist in a valid model. If not present, the default
value is 0.
* `max-occurs` – int – Maximum number of resources of this type that may
exist in a valid model. If not present, the default value depends upon
the value of the final key/value pair in the address of the described
resource. If this value is '*', the default value is Integer.MAX_VALUE,
i.e. there is no limit. If this value is some other string, the default
value is 1.
* `attributes` – Map of String (the attribute name) to complex structure
– the configuration attributes available in this portion of the model.
See the <<description-of-an-attribute,Description of an Attribute>> section
for the representation of each attribute.
* `operations` – Map of String (the operation name) to complex structure
– the operations that can be targeted at this address. See the
<<description-of-an-operation,Description of an Operation>> section
for the representation of each operation.
* `children` – Map of String (the type of child) to complex structure –
the relationship of this portion of the model to other addressable
portions of the model. See the
<<description-of-parentchild-relationships,Description of Parent/Child Relationships>>
section for the representation of each child relationship.
* `head-comment-allowed` – boolean – This description key is for
possible future use.
* `tail-comment-allowed` – boolean – This description key is for
possible future use.

For example:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
{
     "description => "A manageable resource",
     "tail-comment-allowed" => false,
     "attributes" => {
          "foo" => {
               .... details of attribute foo
          }
      },
     "operations" => {
          "start" => {
               .... details of the start operation
          }
      },
     "children" => {
          "bar" => {
               .... details of the relationship with children of type "bar"
          }
      }
}

[[description-of-an-attribute]]
=== Description of an Attribute

An attribute is a portion of the management model that is not directly
addressable. Instead, it is conceptually a property of an addressable
<<management-resources,management resource>>. For
each attribute in the model, the following descriptive information will
be available:

* `description` – String – text description of the attribute
* `type` – `org.jboss.dmr.ModelType` – the type of the attribute value.
One of the enum values BIG_DECIMAL, BIG_INTEGER, BOOLEAN, BYTES, DOUBLE,
INT, LIST, LONG, OBJECT, PROPERTY, STRING. Most of these are
self-explanatory. An OBJECT will be represented in the detyped model as
a map of string keys to values of some other legal type, conceptually
similar to a `javax.management.openmbean.CompositeData`. A PROPERTY is a
single key/value pair, where the key is a string, and the value is of
some other legal type.
* `value-type` – ModelType or complex structure – Only present if type
is LIST or OBJECT. If all elements in the LIST or all the values of the
OBJECT type are of the same type, this will be one of the ModelType
enums BIG_DECIMAL, BIG_INTEGER, BOOLEAN, BYTES, DOUBLE, INT, LONG,
STRING. Otherwise, `value-type` will detail the structure of the
attribute value, enumerating the value's fields and the type of their
value. So, an attribute with a `type` of LIST and a `value-type` value
of `ModelType.STRING` is analogous to a Java `List<String>`, while one
with a `value-type` value of `ModelType.INT` is analogous to a Java
`List<Integer>`. An attribute with a `type` of OBJECT and a `value-type`
value of `ModelType.STRING` is analogous to a Java
`Map<String, String>`. An attribute with a `type` of OBJECT and a
`value-type` whose value is not of type `ModelType` represents a
fully-defined complex object, with the object's legal fields and their
values described.
* `expressions-allowed` – boolean – indicates whether the value of the
attribute may be of type `ModelType.EXPRESSION`, instead of its standard
type (see `type` and `value-type` above for discussion of an attribute's
standard type.) A value of ModelType.EXPRESSION contains a
system-property substitution expression that the server will resolve
against the server-side system property map before using the value. For
example, an attribute named max-threads may have an expression value of
`${example.pool.max-threads:10`} instead of just 10. Default value if
not present is false.
* `required` – boolean – true if the attribute must have a defined value
in a representation of its portion of the model unless another attribute
included in a list of `alternatives` is defined; false if it may be
undefined (implying a null value) even in the absence of alternatives.
If not present, true is the default.
* `nillable` – boolean – true if the attribute might not have a defined
value in a representation of its portion of the model. A nillable
attribute may +
be undefined either because it is not `required` or because it is
required but has `alternatives` and one of the alternatives is defined.
* `storage` – String – Either "configuration" or "runtime". If
"configuration", the attribute's value is stored as part of the
persistent configuration (e.g. in domain.xml, host.xml or
standalone.xml.) If "runtime" the attribute's value is not stored in the
persistent configuration; the value only exists as long as the resource
is running.
* `access-type` – String – One of "read-only", "read-write" or "metric".
Whether an attribute value can be written, or can only read. A "metric"
is a read-only attribute whose value is not stored in the persistent
configuration, and whose value may change due to activity on the server.
If an attribute is "read-write", the resource will expose an operation
named "write-attribute" whose "name" parameter will accept this
attribute's name and whose "value" parameter will accept a valid value
for this attribute. That operation will be the standard means of
updating this attribute's value.
* `restart-required` – String – One of "no-services", "all-services",
"resource-services" or "jvm". Only relevant to attributes whose
access-type is read-write. Indicates whether execution of a
write-attribute operation whose name parameter specifies this attribute
requires a restart of services (or an entire JVM) in order for the
change to take effect in the runtime . See the discussion of
<<applying-updates-to-runtime-services,Applying
Updates to Runtime Services>> below. Default value is "no-services".
* `default` – the default value for the attribute that will be used in
runtime services if the attribute is not explicitly defined and no other
attributes listed as `alternatives` are defined.
* `alternatives` – List of string – Indicates an exclusive relationship
between attributes. If this attribute is defined, the other attributes
listed in this descriptor's value should be undefined, even if their
`required` descriptor says true; i.e. the presence of this attribute
satisfies the requirement. Note that an attribute that is not explicitly
configured but has a `default` value is still regarded as not being
defined for purposes of checking whether the exclusive relationship has
been violated. Default is undefined; i.e. this does not apply to most
attributes.
* `requires` – List of string – Indicates that if this attribute has a
value (other than undefined), the other attributes listed in this
descriptor's value must also have a value, even if their required
descriptor says false. This would typically be used in conjunction with
alternatives. For example, attributes "a" and "b" are required, but are
alternatives to each other; "c" and "d" are optional. But "b" requires
"c" and "d", so if "b" is used, "c" and "d" must also be defined.
Default is undefined; i.e. this does not apply to most attributes.
* `capability-reference` – string – if defined indicates that this
attribute's value specifies the dynamic portion of the name of the
specified capability provided by another resource. This indicates the
attribute is a reference to another area of the management model. (Note
that at present some attributes that reference other areas of the model
may not provide this information.)
* `head-comment-allowed` – boolean – This description key is for
possible future use.
* `tail-comment-allowed` – boolean – This description key is for
possible future use.
* arbitrary key/value pairs that further describe the attribute value,
e.g. "max" => 2. See the <<arbitrary-descriptors,Arbitrary
Descriptors>> section.

Some examples:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
"foo" => {
     "description" => "The foo",
     "type" => INT,
     "max" => 2
}
----

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
"bar" => {
     "description" => "The bar",
     "type" => OBJECT,
     "value-type" => {
          "size" => INT,
          "color" => STRING
     }
}
----

[[description-of-an-operation]]
=== Description of an Operation

A management resource may have operations associated with it. The
description of an operation will include the following information:

* `operation-name` – String – the name of the operation
* `description` – String – text description of the operation
* `request-properties` – Map of String to complex structure –
description of the parameters of the operation. Keys are the names of
the parameters, values are descriptions of the parameter value types.
See
<<description-of-an-operation-parameter-or-return-value,below>>
for details on the description of parameter value types.
* `reply-properties` – complex structure, or empty – description of the
return value of the operation, with an empty node meaning void. See
<<description-of-an-operation-parameter-or-return-value,below>>
for details on the description of operation return value types.
* `restart-required` – String – One of "no-services", "all-services",
"resource-services" or "jvm". Indicates whether the operation makes a
configuration change that requires a restart of services (or an entire
JVM) in order for the change to take effect in the runtime. See
the discussion of <<applying-updates-to-runtime-services,Applying
Updates to Runtime Services>> below. Default value is "no-services".

[[description-of-an-operation-parameter-or-return-value]]
==== Description of an Operation Parameter or Return Value

* `description` – String – text description of the parameter or return
value
* `type` – `org.jboss.dmr.ModelType` – the type of the parameter or
return value. One of the enum values BIG_DECIMAL, BIG_INTEGER, BOOLEAN,
BYTES, DOUBLE, INT, LIST, LONG, OBJECT, PROPERTY, STRING.
* `value-type` – `ModelType` or complex structure – Only present if type
is LIST or OBJECT. If all elements in the LIST or all the values of the
OBJECT type are of the same type, this will be one of the ModelType
enums BIG_DECIMAL, BIG_INTEGER, BOOLEAN, BYTES, DOUBLE, INT, LIST, LONG,
PROPERTY, STRING. Otherwise, value-type will detail the structure of the
attribute value, enumerating the value's fields and the type of their
value.So, a parameter with a `type` of LIST and a `value-type` value of
`ModelType.STRING` is analogous to a Java `List<String>`, while one with
a `value-type` value of `ModelType.INT` is analogous to a Java
`List<Integer>`. A parameter with a `type` of OBJECT and a `value-type`
value of `ModelType.STRING` is analogous to a Java
`Map<String, String>`. A parameter with a `type` of OBJECT and a
`value-type` whose value is not of type `ModelType` represents a
fully-defined complex object, with the object's legal fields and their
values described.
* `expressions-allowed` – boolean – indicates whether the value of the
the parameter or return value may be of type `ModelType.EXPRESSION`,
instead its standard type (see type and value-type above for discussion
of the standard type.) A value of ModelType.EXPRESSION contains a
system-property substitution expression that the server will resolve
against the server-side system property map before using the value. For
example, a parameter named max-threads may have an expression value of
`${example.pool.max-threads:10`} instead of just 10. Default value if
not present is false.
* `required` – boolean – true if the parameter or return value must have
a defined value in the operation or response unless another item
included in a list of `alternatives` is defined; false if it may be
undefined (implying a null value) even in the absence of alternatives.
If not present, true is the default.
* `nillable` – boolean – true if the parameter or return value might not
have a defined value in a representation of its portion of the model. A
nillable parameter or return value may be undefined either because it is
not `required` or because it is required but has `alternatives` and one
of the alternatives is defined.
* `default` – the default value for the parameter that will be used in
runtime services if the parameter is not explicitly defined and no other
parameters listed as `alternatives` are defined.
* `restart-required` – String – One of "no-services", "all-services",
"resource-services" or "jvm". Only relevant to attributes whose
access-type is read-write. Indicates whether execution of a
write-attribute operation whose name parameter specifies this attribute
requires a restart of services (or an entire JVM) in order for the
change to take effect in the runtime . See the discussion of
<<applying-updates-to-runtime-services,Applying
Updates to Runtime Services>> below. Default value is "no-services".
* `alternatives` – List of string – Indicates an exclusive relationship
between parameters. If this attribute is defined, the other parameters
listed in this descriptor's value should be undefined, even if their
required descriptor says true; i.e. the presence of this parameter
satisfies the requirement. Note that an parameer that is not explicitly
configured but has a `default` value is still regarded as not being
defined for purposes of checking whether the exclusive relationship has
been violated. Default is undefined; i.e. this does not apply to most
parameters.
* `requires` – List of string – Indicates that if this parameter has a
value (other than undefined), the other parameters listed in this
descriptor's value must also have a value, even if their required
descriptor says false. This would typically be used in conjunction with
alternatives. For example, parameters "a" and "b" are required, but are
alternatives to each other; "c" and "d" are optional. But "b" requires
"c" and "d", so if "b" is used, "c" and "d" must also be defined.
Default is undefined; i.e. this does not apply to most parameters.
* arbitrary key/value pairs that further describe the attribute value,
e.g. "max" =>2. See the <<arbitrary-descriptors,Arbitrary Descriptors>>
section.

[[arbitrary-descriptors]]
=== Arbitrary Descriptors

The description of an attribute, operation parameter or operation return
value type can include arbitrary key/value pairs that provide extra
information. Whether a particular key/value pair is present depends on
the context, e.g. a pair with key "max" would probably only occur as
part of the description of some numeric type.

Following are standard keys and their expected value type. If descriptor
authors want to add an arbitrary key/value pair to some descriptor and
the semantic matches the meaning of one of the following items, the
standard key/value type must be used.

* `min` – int – the minimum value of some numeric type. The absence of
this item implies there is no minimum value.
* `max` – int – the maximum value of some numeric type. The absence of
this item implies there is no maximum value.
* `min-length` – int – the minimum length of some string, list or byte[]
type. The absence of this item implies a minimum length of zero.
* `max-length` – int – the maximum length of some string, list or
byte[]. The absence of this item implies there is no maximum value.
* `allowed` – List – a list of legal values. The type of the elements in
the list should match the type of the attribute.
* `unit` - The unit of the value, if one is applicable - e.g. ns, ms, s,
m, h, KB, MB, TB. See the
`org.jboss.as.controller.client.helpers.MeasurementUnit` in the
org.jboss.as:jboss-as-controller-client artifact for a listing of legal
measurement units..
* `filesystem-path` – boolean – a flag to indicate that the attribute is a 
path on the filesystem.
* `attached-streams` – boolean – a flag to indicate that the attribute is a 
stream id to an attached stream.
* `relative-to` – boolean – a flag to indicate that the attribute is a 
relative path.
* `feature-reference` – boolean – a flag to indicate that the attribute is a
reference to a provisioning feature via a capability.

Some examples:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
{
     "operation-name" => "incrementFoo",
     "description" => "Increase the value of the 'foo' attribute by the given amount",
     "request-properties" => {
          "increment" => {
               "type" => INT,
               "description" => "The amount to increment",
               "required" => true
     }},
     "reply-properties" => {
               "type" => INT,
               "description" => "The new value",
     }
}
----

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
{
     "operation-name" => "start",
     "description" => "Starts the thing",
     "request-properties" => {},
     "reply-properties" => {}
}
----

[[description-of-parentchild-relationships]]
=== Description of Parent/Child Relationships

The address used to target an addressable portion of the model must be
an ordered list of key value pairs. The effect of this requirement is
the addressable portions of the model naturally form a tree structure,
with parent nodes in the tree defining what the valid keys are and the
children defining what the valid values are. The parent node also
defines the cardinality of the relationship. The description of the
parent node includes a children element that describes these
relationships:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
{
     ....
     "children" => {
          "connector" => {
               .... description of the relationship with children of type "connector"
          },
          "virtual-host" => {
               .... description of the relationship with children of type "virtual-host"
          }
}
----

The description of each relationship will include the following
elements:

* `description` – String – text description of the relationship
* `model-description` – either "undefined" or a complex structure – This
is a node of ModelType.OBJECT, the keys of which are legal values for
the value portion of the address of a resource of this type, with the
special character '*' indicating the value portion can have an arbitrary
value. The values in the node are the full description of the particular
child resource (its text description, attributes, operations, children)
as detailed above. This `model-description` may also be "undefined",
i.e. a null value, if the query that asked for the parent node's
description did not include the "recursive" param set to true.

Example with if the recursive flag was set to true:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
{
     "description" => "The connectors used to handle client connections",
     "model-description" => {
          "*" => {
              "description" => "Handles client connections",
              "min-occurs" => 1,
              "attributes => {
                   ... details of children as documented above
              },
              "operations" => {
                   .... details of operations as documented above
              },
              "children" => {
                   .... details of the children's children
              }
          }
     }
}
----

If the recursive flag was false:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
{
     "description" => "The connectors used to handle client connections",
     "model-description" => undefined
}
----

[[applying-updates-to-runtime-services]]
=== Applying Updates to Runtime Services

An attribute or operation description may include a `restart-required`
descriptor; this section is an explanation of the
meaning of that descriptor.

An operation that changes a management resource's persistent
configuration usually can also also affect a runtime service associated
with the resource. For example, there is a runtime service associated
with any host.xml or standalone.xml `<interface>` element; other
services in the runtime depend on that service to provide the
`InetAddress` associated with the interface. In many cases, an update to
a resource's persistent configuration can be immediately applied to the
associated runtime service. The runtime service's state is updated to
reflect the new value(s).

However, in many cases the runtime service's state cannot be updated
without restarting the service. Restarting a service can have broad
effects. A restart of a service A will trigger a restart of other
services B, C and D that depend on A, triggering a restart of services that
depend on B, C and D, etc. Those service restarts may very well disrupt
handling of end-user requests.

Because restarting a service can be disruptive to end-user request
handling, the handlers for management operations will not restart any
service without some form of explicit instruction from the end user
indicating a service restart is desired. In a few cases, simply
executing the operation is an indication the user wants services to
restart (e.g. a `/host=master/server-config=server-one:restart`
operation in a managed domain, or a `/:reload` operation on a standalone
server.) For all other cases, if an operation (or attribute write)
cannot be performed without restarting a service, the metadata
describing the operation or attribute will include a `restart-required`
descriptor whose value indicates what is necessary
for the operation to affect the runtime:

* `no-services` – Applying the operation to the runtime does not require
the restart of any services. This value is the default if the
restart-required descriptor is not present.
* `all-services` – The operation can only immediately update the
persistent configuration; applying the operation to the runtime will
require a subsequent restart of all services in the affected VM.
Executing the operation will put the server into a `reload-required`
state. Until a restart of all services is performed the response to this
operation and to any subsequent operation will include a response header
`"process-state" => "reload-required"`. For a standalone server, a
restart of all services can be accomplished by executing the `reload`
CLI command. For a server in a managed domain, restarting all services
is done via a reload operation targeting the particular server (e.g.
`/host=master/server=server-one:reload`).
* `jvm` --The operation can only immediately update the persistent
configuration; applying the operation to the runtime will require a full
process restart (i.e. stop the JVM and launch a new JVM). Executing the
operation will put the server into a `restart-required` state. Until
a restart is performed the response to this operation and to any
subsequent operation will include a response header
`"process-state" => "restart-required"`. For a standalone server, a full
process restart requires first stopping the server via OS-level
operations (Ctrl-C, kill) or via the `shutdown` CLI command, and then
starting the server again from the command line. For a server in a
managed domain, restarting a server requires executing the
`/host=<host>/server-config=<server>:restart` operation.
* `resource-services` – The operation can only immediately update the
persistent configuration; applying the operation to the runtime will
require a subsequent restart of some services associated with the
resource. If the operation includes the request header
`"allow-resource-service-restart" => true`, the handler for the
operation will go ahead and restart the runtime service. Otherwise
executing the operation will put the server into a `reload-required`
state. (See the discussion of `all-services` above for more on the
`reload-required` state.)
