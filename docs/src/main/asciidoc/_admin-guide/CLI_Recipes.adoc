For standalone mode:

The attribute for interface is named "resolved-address". It's a runtime

to add the "include-runtime" parameter.

[[scripting]]
== Scripting

[[windows-and-press-any-key-to-continue-...-issue]]
=== Windows and "Press any key to continue ..." issue

WildFly scripts for Windows end with "Press any key to continue ...".
This behavior is useful when script is executed by double clicking the
script but not when you need to invoke several commands from custom
script (e.g. 'bin/jboss-admin.bat --connect command=:shutdown').

To avoid "Press any key to continue ..." message you need to specify
NOPAUSE variable. Call 'set NOPAUSE=true' in command line before running
any WildFly {wildflyVersion} .bat script or include it in your custom script before
invoking scripts from WildFly.

[[deployment]]
== Deployment

[[undeploying-and-redeploying-multiple-deployments]]
=== Undeploying and redeploying multiple deployments

CLI offers a way to efficiently undeploy or redeploy deployments in one
simple command.

* To disable all enabled deployments: _undeploy --keep-content *_
* To redeploy all disabled deployments: _deploy --name=*_

[[incremental-deployment-with-the-cli]]
=== Incremental deployment with the CLI

It can be desirable to incrementally create and(or) update a WildFly
deployment. This chapter details how this can be achieved using the
WildFly CLI tool.

Steps to create an empty deployment and add an index html file.

1.  Create an empty deployment named my app:
+
[source, ruby]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /deployment=myapp:add(content=[{empty=true}])
----
2.  Add an index.html to my app:
+
[source, ruby]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /deployment=myapp:add-content(content=[{input-stream-index=<press TAB>
----
+
Then use completion to navigate to your index.html file.
3.  Provide a target name for index.html inside the deployment and
execute the operation:
+
[source,ruby]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /deployment=myapp:add-content(content=[{input-stream-index=./index.html, target-path=index.xhtml}]
----
4.  Your content has been added, you can browse the content of a
deployment using the browse-content operation:
+
[source,ruby]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /deployment=myapp:browse-content(path=./)
----
5.  You can display (or save) the content of a deployed file using the
_attachement_ command:
+
[source,ruby]
----
attachment display --operation=/deployment=myapp:read-content(path=index.xhtml)
----
6.  You can remove content from a deployment:
+
[source,ruby]
----
/deployment=myapp:remove-content(paths=[./index.xhtml])
----

Tips

[TIP]

* _add-content_ operation allows you to add more than one file (
_content_ argument is a list of complex types).
* CLI offers completion for __browse-conten__t's _path_ and
_remove-content_'s _paths_ argument.
* You can safely use operations that are using attached streams in batch
operations. In the case of batch operations, streams are attached to the
composite operation.

[WARNING]

On Windows, path separator '\' needs to be escaped, this is a limitation
of CLI handling complex types. The file path completion is automatically
escaping the paths it is proposing.

[[notes-for-server-side-operation-handler-implementors]]
==== Notes for server side operation Handler implementors

In order to benefit from CLI support for attached file streams and file
system completion, you need to properly structure your operation
arguments. Steps to create an operation that receives a list of file
streams attached to the operation:

1.  Define your operation argument as a _LIST_ of _INT_ (The _LIST_
_value-type_ must be of type _INT_).
2.  In the description of your argument, add the 2 following boolean
descriptors: _filesystem-path_ and _attached-streams_

When your operation is called from the CLI, file system completion will
be automatically proposed for your argument. At execution time, the file
system paths will be automatically converted onto the index of the
attached streams.

[[downloading-files-with-the-cli]]
== Downloading files with the CLI

Some management resources are exposing the content of files in the
matter of _streams_. Streams returned by a management operation are
attached to the headers of the management response. The CLI command
_attachment_ (see CLI help for a detailed description of this command)
allows to display or save the content of the attached streams.

* Displaying the content of server.log file:
+
[source, ruby]
----
attachment display --operation=/subsystem=logging/log-file=server.log:read-resource(include-runtime)
----
* Saving locally the server.log file:
+
[source, ruby]
----
attachment save --operation=/subsystem=logging/log-file=server.log:read-resource(include-runtime) --file=./server.log
----
* Displaying the content of a deployed file:
+
[source,ruby]
----
attachment display --operation=/deployment=myapp:read-content(path=index.xhtml)
----

[TIP]

* By default existing files will be preserved. Use the option
_--overwrite_ to overwrite existing file.
* _attachment_ can be used in batch mode.
