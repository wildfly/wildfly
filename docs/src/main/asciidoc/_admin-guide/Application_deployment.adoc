[[managed-domain]]
== Managed Domain

In a managed domain, deployments are associated with a `server-group`
(see ﻿ <<Core_management_concepts,Core management concepts>>).
Any server within the server group will then be provided with that
deployment.

The domain and host controller components manage the distribution of
binaries across network boundaries.

[[deployment-commands]]
=== Deployment Commands

Distributing deployment binaries involves two steps: uploading the
deployment to the repository the domain controller will use to
distribute its contents, and then assigning the deployment to one or
more server groups.

You can do this in one sweep with the CLI:

[source, ruby]
----
[domain@localhost:9990 /] deploy ~/Desktop/test-application.war
Either --all-server-groups or --server-groups must be specified.
 
[domain@localhost:9990 /] deploy ~/Desktop/test-application.war --all-server-groups
'test-application.war' deployed successfully.
----

The deployment will be available to the domain controller, assigned to a
server group, and deployed on all running servers in that group:

[source, ruby]
----
[domain@localhost:9990 /] :read-children-names(child-type=deployment)
{
   "outcome" => "success",
   "result" => [
       "mysql-connector-java-5.1.15.jar",
       "test-application.war"
   ]
}
 
[domain@localhost:9990 /] /server-group=main-server-group/deployment=test-application.war:read-resource(include-runtime)
{
   "outcome" => "success",
   "result" => {
       "enabled" => true,
       "name" => "test-application.war",
       "managed" => true,
       "runtime-name" => "test-application.war"
   }
}
----

If you only want the deployment deployed on servers in some server
groups, but not all, use the `--server-groups` parameter instead of
`-all-server-groups`:

[source, ruby]
----
[domain@localhost:9990 /] deploy ~/Desktop/test-application.war --server-groups=main-server-group,another-group
'test-application.war' deployed successfully.
----

If you have a new version of the deployment that you want to deploy
replacing an existing one, use the `--force` parameter:

[source, ruby]
----
[domain@localhost:9990 /] deploy ~/Desktop/test-application.war --all-server-groups --force
'test-application.war' deployed successfully.
----

You can remove binaries from server groups with the `undeploy` command:

[source, ruby]
----
[domain@localhost:9990 /] undeploy test-application.war --all-relevant-server-groups
Successfully undeployed test-application.war.
 
[domain@localhost:9990 /] /server-group=main-server-group:read-children-names(child-type=deployment)
{
   "outcome" => "success",
   "result" => []
}
----

If you only want to undeploy from some server groups but not others, use
the `-` `server-groups` parameter instead of
`-all-relevant-server-groups`.

The CLI `deploy` command supports a number of other parameters that can
control behavior. Use the `--help` parameter to learn more:

[source, ruby]
----
[domain@localhost:9990 /] deploy --help
[...]
----

[TIP]

Managing deployments through the web interface provides an alternate,
sometimes simpler approach.

[[exploded-managed-deployments]]
=== Exploded managed deployments

Managed and unmanaged deployments can be 'exploded', i.e. on the
filesystem in the form of a directory structure whose structure
corresponds to an unzipped version of the archive. An exploded
deployment can be convenient to administer if your administrative
processes involve inserting or replacing files from a base version in
order to create a version tailored for a particular use (for example,
copy in a base deployment and then copy in a jboss-web.xml file to
tailor a deployment for use in WildFly.) Exploded deployments are also
nice in some development scenarios, as you can replace static content
(e.g. .html, .css) files in the deployment and have the new content
visible immediately without requiring a redeploy.

Since unmanaged deployment content is directly in your charge, the
following operations only make sense for a managed deployment.

----
[domain@localhost:9990 /] /deployment=exploded.war:add(content=[{empty=true}])
----

This will create an empty exploded deployment to which you'll be able to
add content. The *empty* content parameter is required to check that you
really intend to create an empty deployment and not just forget to
define the content.

----
[domain@localhost:9990 /] /deployment=kitchensink.ear:explode()
----

This will 'explode' an existing archive deployment to its exploded
format. This operation is not recursive so you need to explode the
sub-deployment if you want to be able to manipulate the sub-deployment
content. You can do this by specifying the sub-deployment archive *path*
as a parameter to the explode operation.

----
[domain@localhost:9990 /] /deployment=kitchensink.ear:explode(path=wildfly-kitchensink-ear-web.war)
----

Now you can add or remove content to your exploded deployment. Note that
per-default this will overwrite existing contents, you can specify the
overwrite parameter to make the operation fail if the content already
exists.

----
[domain@localhost:9990 /] /deployment=exploded.war:add-content(content=[{target-path=WEB-INF/classes/org/jboss/as/test/deployment/trivial/ServiceActivatorDeployment.class, input-stream-index=/home/demo/org/jboss/as/test/deployment/trivial/ServiceActivatorDeployment.class}, {target-path=META-INF/MANIFEST.MF, input-stream-index=/home/demo/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF}, {target-path=META-INF/services/org.jboss.msc.service.ServiceActivator, input-stream-index=/home/demo/META-INF/services/org.jboss.msc.service.ServiceActivator}])
----

Each content specifies a source content and the target path to which it
will be copied relative to the deployment root. With WildFly 11 you can
use *input-stream-index* (which was a convenient way to pass a stream of
content) from the CLI by pointing it to a local file.

----
[domain@localhost:9990 /] /deployment=exploded.war:remove-content(paths=[WEB-INF/classes/org/jboss/as/test/deployment/trivial/ServiceActivatorDeployment.class, META-INF/MANIFEST.MF, META-INF/services/org.jboss.msc.service.ServiceActivator])
----

Now you can list the content of an exploded deployment, or just some
part of it.

[source, ruby]
----
[domain@localhost:9990 /] /deployment=kitchensink.ear:browse-content(archive=false, path=wildfly-kitchensink-ear-web.war)

            "file-size" => 146L
        }
    ]
}
----

You also have a *read-content* operation but since it returns a binary
stream, this is not displayable from the CLI.

[source, ruby]
----
[domain@localhost:9990 /] /deployment=kitchensink.ear:read-content(path=META-INF/MANIFEST.MF)
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "result" => {"uuid" => "b373d587-72ee-4b1e-a02a-71fbb0c85d32"},
    "response-headers" => {"attached-streams" => [{
        "uuid" => "b373d587-72ee-4b1e-a02a-71fbb0c85d32",
        "mime-type" => "text/plain"
    }]}
}
----

The management CLI however provides high level commands to display or
save binary stream attachments:

[source, ruby]
----
[domain@localhost:9990 /] attachment display --operation=/deployment=kitchensink.ear:read-content(path=META-INF/MANIFEST.MF)
ATTACHMENT d052340a-abb7-4a66-aa24-4eeeb6b256be:
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Archiver-Version: Plexus Archiver
Built-By: mjurc
Created-By: Apache Maven 3.3.9
Build-Jdk: 1.8.0_91
----

----
[domain@localhost:9990 /] attachment save --operation=/deployment=kitchensink.ear:read-content(path=META-INF/MANIFEST.MF) --file=example
File saved to /home/mjurc/wildfly/build/target/wildfly-11.0.0.Alpha1-SNAPSHOT/example
----

[[xml-configuration-file]]
=== XML Configuration File

When you deploy content, the domain controller adds two types of entries
to the `domain.xml` configuration file, one showing global information
about the deployment, and another for each relevant server group showing
how it is used by that server group:

[source, xml]
----
[...]
<deployments>
   <deployment name="test-application.war"
               runtime-name="test-application.war">
       <content sha1="dda9881fa7811b22f1424b4c5acccb13c71202bd"/>
   </deployment>
</deployments>
[...]
<server-groups>
   <server-group name="main-server-group" profile="default">
       [...]
       <deployments>
           <deployment name="test-application.war" runtime-name="test-application.war"/>
       </deployments>
   </server-group>
</server-groups>
[...]
----

~(See domain/configuration/domain.xml)~

[[standalone-server]]
== Standalone Server

Deployments on a standalone server work in a similar way to those on
managed domains. The main difference is that there are no server group
associations.

[[deployment-commands-1]]
=== Deployment Commands

The same CLI commands used for managed domains work for standalone
servers when deploying and removing an application:

[source, ruby]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] deploy ~/Desktop/test-application.war
'test-application.war' deployed successfully.
 
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] undeploy test-application.war
Successfully undeployed test-application.war.
----

[[deploying-using-the-deployment-scanner]]
=== Deploying Using the Deployment Scanner

Deployment content (for example, war, ear, jar, and sar files) can be
placed in the standalone/deployments directory of the WildFly
distribution, in order to be automatically deployed into the server
runtime. For this to work the `deployment-scanner` subsystem must be
present. The scanner periodically checks the contents of the deployments
directory and reacts to changes by updating the server.

[IMPORTANT]

Users are encouraged to use the WildFly management APIs to upload and
deploy deployment content instead of relying on the deployment scanner
that periodically scans the directory, particularly if running
production systems.

[[deployment-scanner-modes]]
==== Deployment Scanner Modes

The WildFly filesystem deployment scanner operates in one of two
different modes, depending on whether it will directly monitor the
deployment content in order to decide to deploy or redeploy it.

Auto-deploy mode:

The scanner will directly monitor the deployment content, automatically
deploying new content and redeploying content whose timestamp has
changed. This is similiar to the behavior of previous AS releases,
although there are differences:

* A change in any file in an exploded deployment triggers redeploy.
Because EE 6+ applications do not require deployment descriptors, +
there is no attempt to monitor deployment descriptors and only redeploy
when a deployment descriptor changes.
* The scanner will place marker files in this directory as an indication
of the status of its attempts to deploy or undeploy content. These are
detailed below.

Manual deploy mode:

The scanner will not attempt to directly monitor the deployment content
and decide if or when the end user wishes the content to be deployed.
Instead, the scanner relies on a system of marker files, with the user's
addition or removal of a marker file serving as a sort of command
telling the scanner to deploy, undeploy or redeploy content.

Auto-deploy mode and manual deploy mode can be independently configured
for zipped deployment content and exploded deployment content. This is
done via the "auto-deploy" attribute on the deployment-scanner element
in the standalone.xml configuration file:

[source, xml]
----
<deployment-scanner scan-interval="5000" relative-to="jboss.server.base.dir"
   path="deployments" auto-deploy-zipped="true" auto-deploy-exploded="false"/>
----

By default, auto-deploy of zipped content is enabled, and auto-deploy of
exploded content is disabled. Manual deploy mode is strongly recommended
for exploded content, as exploded content is inherently vulnerable to
the scanner trying to auto-deploy partially copied content.

[[marker-files]]
==== Marker Files

The marker files always have the same name as the deployment content to
which they relate, but with an additional file suffix appended. For
example, the marker file to indicate the example.war file should be
deployed is named example.war.dodeploy. Different marker file suffixes
have different meanings.

The relevant marker file types are:

[cols=",",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|File |Purpose

|.dodeploy |Placed by the user to indicate that the given content
shouldbe deployed into the runtime (or redeployed if alreadydeployed in
the runtime.)

|.skipdeploy |Disables auto-deploy of the content for as long as the
fileis present. Most useful for allowing updates to explodedcontent
without having the scanner initiate redeploy in themiddle of the update.
Can be used with zipped content aswell, although the scanner will detect
in-progress changesto zipped content and wait until changes are
complete.

|.isdeploying |Placed by the deployment scanner service to indicate that
ithas noticed a .dodeploy file or new or updated auto-deploymode content
and is in the process of deploying the content.This marker file will be
deleted when the deployment processcompletes.

|.deployed |Placed by the deployment scanner service to indicate that
thegiven content has been deployed into the runtime. If an enduser
deletes this file, the content will be undeployed.

|.failed |Placed by the deployment scanner service to indicate that
thegiven content failed to deploy into the runtime. The contentof the
file will include some information about the cause ofthe failure. Note
that with auto-deploy mode, removing thisfile will make the deployment
eligible for deployment again.

|.isundeploying |Placed by the deployment scanner service to indicate
that ithas noticed a .deployed file has been deleted and thecontent is
being undeployed. This marker file will be deletedwhen the undeployment
process completes.

|.undeployed |Placed by the deployment scanner service to indicate that
thegiven content has been undeployed from the runtime. If an enduser
deletes this file, it has no impact.

|.pending |Placed by the deployment scanner service to indicate that
ithas noticed the need to deploy content but has not yetinstructed the
server to deploy it. This file is created ifthe scanner detects that
some auto-deploy content is still inthe process of being copied or if
there is some problem thatprevents auto-deployment. The scanner will not
instruct theserver to deploy or undeploy any content (not just
thedirectly affected content) as long as this condition holds.
|=======================================================================

==== Basic workflows:

All examples assume variable $JBOSS_HOME points to the root of the
WildFly distribution.

[upperalpha]
. Add new zipped content and deploy it:
[arabic]
..  cp target/example.war/ $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments
..  (Manual mode only) touch
$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments/example.war.dodeploy
. Add new unzipped content and deploy it:
..  cp -r target/example.war/ $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments
..  (Manual mode only) touch
$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments/example.war.dodeploy
. Undeploy currently deployed content:
..  rm $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments/example.war.deployed
. Auto-deploy mode only: Undeploy currently deployed content:
..  rm $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments/example.war
. Replace currently deployed zipped content with a new version and deploy it:
..  cp target/example.war/ $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments
..  (Manual mode only) touch
$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments/example.war.dodeploy
. Manual mode only: Replace currently deployed unzipped content with a
new version and deploy it:
..  rm $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments/example.war.deployed
..  wait for $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments/example.war.undeployed
file to appear
..  cp -r target/example.war/ $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments
..  touch $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments/example.war.dodeploy
. Auto-deploy mode only: Replace currently deployed unzipped content
with a new version and deploy it:
..  touch $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments/example.war.skipdeploy
..  cp -r target/example.war/ $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments
..  rm $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments/example.war.skipdeploy
. Manual mode only: Live replace portions of currently deployed
unzipped content without redeploying:
.. cp -r target/example.war/foo.html
$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments/example.war
. Auto-deploy mode only: Live replace portions of currently deployed
unzipped content without redeploying:
..  touch $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments/example.war.skipdeploy
..  cp -r target/example.war/foo.html
$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments/example.war
. Manual or auto-deploy mode: Redeploy currently deployed content
(i.e. bounce it with no content change):
..  touch $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments/example.war.dodeploy
. Auto-deploy mode only: Redeploy currently deployed content (i.e.
bounce it with no content change):
..  touch $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments/example.war

[TIP]

The above examples use Unix shell commands. Windows equivalents are:
cp src dest --> xcopy /y src dest +
cp -r src dest --> xcopy /e /s /y src dest +
rm afile --> del afile +
touch afile --> echo>> afile

Note that the behavior of 'touch' and 'echo' are different but the
differences are not relevant to the usages in the examples above.

[[managed-and-unmanaged-deployments]]
== Managed and Unmanaged Deployments

WildFly supports two mechanisms for dealing with deployment content –
managed and unmanaged deployments.

With a managed deployment the server takes the deployment content and
copies it into an internal content repository and thereafter uses that
copy of the content, not the original user-provided content. The server
is thereafter responsible for the content it uses.

With an unmanaged deployment the user provides the local filesystem path
of deployment content, and the server directly uses that content.
However the user is responsible for ensuring that content, e.g. for
making sure that no changes are made to it that will negatively impact
the functioning of the deployed application.

To help you differentiate managed from unmanaged deployments the
deployment model has a runtime boolean attribute 'managed'.

Managed deployments have a number of benefits over unmanaged:

* They can be manipulated by remote management clients, not requiring
access to the server filesystem.
* In a managed domain, WildFly/EAP will take responsibility for
replicating a copy of the deployment to all hosts/servers in the domain
where it is needed. With an unmanaged deployment, it is the user's
responsibility to have the deployment available on the local filesystem
on all relevant hosts, at a consistent path.
* The deployment content actually used is stored on the filesystem in
the internal content repository, which should help shelter it from
unintended changes.

All of the previous examples above illustrate using managed deployments,
except for any discussion of deployment scanner handling of exploded
deployments. In WildFly 10 and earlier exploded deployments are always
unmanaged, this is no longer the case since WildFly 11.

[[content-repository]]
=== Content Repository

For a managed deployment, the actual file the server uses when creating
runtime services is not the file provided to the CLI `deploy` command or
to the web console. It is a copy of that file stored in an internal
content repository. The repository is located in the
`domain/data/content` directory for a managed domain, or in
`standalone/data/content` for a standalone server. Actual binaries are
stored in a subdirectory:

[source,bash]
----
ls domain/data/content/
  |---/47
  |-----95cc29338b5049e238941231b36b3946952991
  |---/dd
  |-----a9881fa7811b22f1424b4c5acccb13c71202bd
----

[TIP]

The location of the content repository and its internal structure is
subject to change at any time and should not be relied upon by end
users.

The description of a managed deployment in the domain or standalone
configuration file includes an attribute recording the SHA1 hash of the
deployment content:

[source, xml]
----
<deployments>
   <deployment name="test-application.war"
               runtime-name="test-application.war">
       <content sha1="dda9881fa7811b22f1424b4c5acccb13c71202bd"/>
   </deployment>
</deployments>
----

The WildFly process calculates and records that hash when the user
invokes a management operation (e.g. CLI `deploy` command or using the
console) providing deployment content. The user is not expected to
calculate the hash.

The sha1 attribute in the content element tells the WildFly process
where to find the deployment content in its internal content repository.

In a domain each host will have a copy of the content needed by its
servers in its own local content repository. The WildFly domain
controller and slave host controller processes take responsibility for
ensuring each host has the needed content.

[[unmanaged-deployments]]
=== Unmanaged Deployments

An unmanaged deployment is one where the server directly deploys the
content at a path you specify instead of making an internal copy and
then deploying the copy.

Initially deploying an unmanaged deployment is much like deploying a
managed one, except you tell WildFly that you do not want the deployment
to be managed:

[source]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] deploy ~/Desktop/test-application.war --unmanaged
'test-application.war' deployed successfully.
----

When you do this, instead of the server making a copy of the content at
`/Desktop/test-application.war`, calculating the hash of the content,
storing the hash in the configuration file and then installing the copy
into the runtime, instead it will convert
`/Desktop/test-application.war` to an absolute path, store the path in
the configuration file, and then install the original content in the
runtime.

You can also use unmanaged deployments in a domain:

[source]
----
[domain@localhost:9990 /] deploy /home/example/Desktop/test-application.war --server-group=main-server-group --unmanaged
'test-application.war' deployed successfully.
----

However, before you run this command you must ensure that a copy of the
content is present on all machines that have servers in the target
server groups, all at the same filesystem path. The domain will not copy
the file for you.

Undeploy is no different from a managed undeploy:

[source]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] undeploy test-application.war
Successfully undeployed test-application.war.
----

Doing a replacement of the deployment with a new version is a bit
different, the server is using the file you want to replace. You should
undeploy the deployment, replace the content, and then deploy again. Or
you can stop the server, replace the deployment and deploy again.
