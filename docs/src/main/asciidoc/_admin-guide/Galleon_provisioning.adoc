[[Galleon_Provisioning]]
= Provisioning WildFly with Galleon

With the WildFly server being internally built using the https://github.com/wildfly/galleon[Galleon project], WildFly benefits +
from Galleon's provisioning capabilities. One of the main features that Galleon brings to WildFly is the ability
to install a complete or customized WildFly server using Galleon tooling.

More information on Galleon features and tooling can be found in the Galleon https://docs.wildfly.org/galleon/[docs].

== WildFly Galleon feature-packs

WildFly provides a Galleon feature-pack maven artifact (a zipped file that contains installation content). 
This feature-pack, as well as the feature-packs on which its depends (core and servlet feature-packs),
are deployed in public maven repositories. 

When Galleon is used to install WildFly, WildFly feature-packs are retrieved and 
their content is assembled to create an installation.

== Installing WildFly using Galleon

The Galleon maven plugin or Galleon CLI are used to install WildFly. The latest CLI and documentation can be downloaded 
from the Galleon releases https://github.com/wildfly/galleon/releases[page].

To install the latest final version of WildFly into the directory _my-wildfly-server_ call:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
galleon.sh install wildfly:current --dir=my-wildfly-server
----

Once installed, the directory _my-wildfly-server_ contains all that is expected to run a complete WildFly server. 
By default, all standalone and domain configurations are installed.

[NOTE]
====

Append the release version to install an identified release, for example:
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
galleon.sh install wildfly:current#16.0.0.Final --dir=my-wildfly-server
----
Use _wildfly-core:current_ to only install a core server, for example:
----
galleon.sh install wildfly-core:current --dir=my-core-server
----
Use _wildfly-servlet:current_ to only install a servlet server, for example:
----
galleon.sh install wildfly-servlet:current --dir=my-servlet-server
----
====

== Selecting the configurations to install

Galleon allows you to specify only a subset of the default configurations to be installed.

To only install the standalone.xml configuration call:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
galleon.sh install wildfly:current --dir=my-wildfly-server --default-configs=standalone/standalone.xml
----

To install multiple configurations, a comma separated list of default configurations can be provided, 
for example:
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
galleon.sh install wildfly:current --dir=my-wildfly-server --default-configs=standalone/standalone.xml,domain/domain.xml
----

[NOTE]
====

A default configuration is identified by _<configuration model>_/_<configuration name>_. WildFly defines _standalone_ and _domain_ models. 
The _configuration name_ is the XML configuration file name (e.g.: _standalone.xml_, _domain.xml_, _standalone-ha.xml_).
====

== WildFly Galleon layers

WildFly Galleon feature-packs expose some link:++https://docs.wildfly.org/galleon/#_layers++[Galleon layers]. 
A layer identifies one or more server functionalities that can be installed on its own or 
in combination with other layers. For example, if your application (e.g.: microservice) 
is only making use of _jaxrs_ and _cdi_ server functionalities, you can choose to only install 
the _jaxrs_ and _cdi_ layers. The _standalone.xml_ configuration would then only contain the 
required subsystems and their dependencies.

The benefit to installing WildFly using Galleon layers, in addition to configuration 
trim down, is that Galleon only installs the needed content (JBOSS Modules modules, scripts, etc.).

To install a server only configured with jaxrs and cdi functionalities call:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
galleon.sh install wildfly:current --dir=my-wildfly-server --layers=cdi,jaxrs
----

Once installed, the directory _my-wildfly-server_ contains all that is expected to deploy an application
that depends on _jaxrs_ and _cdi_. 

[NOTE]
====

* Tools (jboss-cli, add-user, ...) are not installed when installing WildFly using layers. 
Only server launcher scripts are installed into the _bin_ directory. To include these tools include the _core-tools_ layer.

=== Defined Galleon layers

==== Note on layers and feature-pack dependencies

When installing a feature-pack, its own defined layers as well as the layers present in its dependencies 
can be combined to build a custom configuration. This means that core and servlet defined layers can be combined with 
WildFly defined layers to assemble a custom configuration. <<galleon-cli-recipes>> contains examples of such combination of layers.

==== WildFly layers

Basic layers:

* _cdi_: Support for cdi.
* _jaxrs_: Support for jaxrs.
* _jms-activemq_: Support for connections to a remote jms broker. 
* _jpa_: Support for jpa (latest WildFly supported hibernate release).
* _observability_: Support for microprofile monitoring and configuration features (config, health, metrics, open-tracing).
* _resource-adapters_: Support for deployment of JCA adapters.
* _h2-driver_: Support for h2 driver.
* _h2-datasource_: Support for h2 datasource.
* _h2-default-datasource_: Support for h2 datasource set as ee subsystem default datasource.

Aggregation layers:

* _cloud-profile_, an aggregation of the basic layers (except _h2-*_ layers).

[NOTE]
====
These layers depend at least on the _web-server_ layer defined in the WildFly servlet 
feature-pack (on which WildFly feature-pack depends). This means that when creating an 
installation with these layers, the installed WildFly server is also configured to be a servlet container. 
====

==== WildFly servlet layers

Basic layers:

* _ee_: Support for common functionality in the Java EE platform.
* _legacy-security_: Support for legacy web security. 
* _naming_: Support for JNDI.
* _undertow_: Support for the Undertow HTTP server.
* _undertow-load-balancer_: Support for Undertow configured as a load balancer.
* _vault_: Support Picketbox security vaults.

Servlet support layer:

* _web-server_: A servlet container composed of _ee_, _naming_, _deployment-scanner_ 
(from WildFly core feature-pack) and _undertow_ configured as a servlet container.

==== WildFly core layers

Basic layers:

* _base-server_: Empty runnable server.
* _core-management_: Support for server management services.
* _deployment-scanner_: Support for deployment directory scanning.
* _discovery_: Support for discovery.
* _elytron_: Support for Elytron security.
* _io_: Support for XNIO workers and buffer pools.
* _jmx_: Support for registration of Management Model MBeans.
* _jmx-remoting_: Support for registration of Management Model MBeans and a JMX remoting connector.
* _logging_: Support for logging subsystem.
* _management_: Support for remote access to management interfaces.
* _remoting_: Support for inbound and outbound JBOSS Remoting connections.
* _request-controller_: Support for request management.
* _secure-management_: Support for remote access secured thanks to Elytron to management interfaces.
* _security-management_: Support for security manager.

Aggregation layers:

* _core-server_: Aggregation of layers that compose a typical core server: _secure-management_, 
_jmx-remoting_, _logging_, _core-management_, _request-controller_ and _security-manager_.

Tools layers:

* _core-tools_: Support for _jboss-cli_, _add-user_, _elytron-tool_ launch scripts and configuration files.
