[[Command_Line_Interface]]
= Command Line Interface

The Command Line Interface (CLI) is a management tool for a managed
domain or standalone server. It allows a user to connect to the domain
controller or a standalone server and execute management operations
available through the de-typed management model.

[[running-the-cli]]
== Running the CLI

Depending on the operating system, the CLI is launched using
`jboss-cli.sh` or `jboss-cli.bat` located in the WildFly `bin`
directory. For further information on the default directory structure,
please consult the " link:Getting_Started_Guide{outfilesuffix}[Getting Started
Guide]".

The first thing to do after the CLI has started is to connect to a
managed WildFly instance. This is done using the command _connect_, e.g.

[source, java]
----
./bin/jboss-cli.sh
You are disconnected at the moment. Type 'connect' to connect to the server
or 'help' for the list of supported commands.
[disconnected /]
 
[disconnected /] connect
[domain@localhost:9990 /]
 
[domain@localhost:9990 /] quit
Closed connection to localhost:9990
----

`localhost:9990` is the default host and port combination for the
WildFly CLI client.

The host and the port of the server can be provided as an optional
parameter, if the server is not listening on localhost:9990.

[source, java]
----
./bin/jboss-cli.sh
You are disconnected at the moment. Type 'connect' to connect to the server
[disconnected /] connect 192.168.0.10:9990
Connected to standalone controller at 192.168.0.1:9990
----

The :9990 is not required as the CLI will use port 9990 by default. The
port needs to be provided if the server is listening on some other port.

To terminate the session type _quit_.

[TIP]

The jboss-cli script accepts a --connect parameter: ./jboss-cli.sh
--connect

The --controller parameter can be used to specify the host and port of
the server: ./jboss-cli.sh --connect --controller=192.168.0.1:9990

Help is also available:

[source, java]
----
[domain@localhost:9990 /] help --commands
Commands available in the current context:
batch               connection-factory  deployment-overlay  if                  patch               reload              try
cd                  connection-info     echo                jdbc-driver-info    pwd                 rollout-plan        undeploy
clear               data-source         echo-dmr            jms-queue           quit                run-batch           unset
command             deploy              help                jms-topic           read-attribute      set                 version
connect             deployment-info     history             ls                  read-operation      shutdown            xa-data-source
To read a description of a specific command execute 'command_name --help'.
----

[[non-interactive-mode]]
== Non-interactive Mode

The CLI can also be run in non-interactive mode to support scripts and
other types of command line or batch processing. The --command and
--commands arguments can be used to pass a command or a list of commands
to execute. Additionally a --file argument is supported which enables
CLI commands to be provided from a text file.

For example the following command can be used to list all the current
deployments

[source,bash]
----
$ ./bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --commands=ls\ deployment
sample.war
osgi-bundle.jar
----

The output can be combined with other shell commands for further
processing, for example to find out what .war files are deployed:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --commands=ls\ deployment | grep war
sample.war
----

In order to match a command with its output, you can provide the option
--echo-command (or add the XML element <echo-command> to the CLI
configuration file) in order to make the CLI to include the prompt +
command + options in the output. With this option enabled, any executed
command will be added to the output.

[[command-timeout]]
== Command timeout

By default CLI command and operation executions are not timely bounded.
It means that a command never ending its execution will make the CLI
process to be stuck and unresponsive. To protect the CLI from this
behavior, one can set a command execution timeout.

[[command-timeout-behavior]]
=== Command Timeout behavior

In interactive mode, when a timeout occurs, an error message is
displayed then the console prompt is made available to type new
commands. In non interactive mode (executing a script or a list of
commands), when a timeout occurs, an exception is thrown and the CLI
execution is stopped. In both modes (interactive and non interactive),
when a timeout occurs, the CLI will make a best effort to cancel the
associated server side activities.

[[configuring-the-command-timeout]]
=== Configuring the Command timeout

* Add the XML element _<command-timeout>\{num
seconds}</command-timeout>_ to the CLI XML configuration file.
* Add the option - _-command-timeout=\{num seconds}_ to the CLI command
line. This will override any value set in the XML configuration file.

[[managing-the-command-timeout]]
=== Managing the Command Timeout

Once the CLI is running, the timeout can be adjusted to cope with the
commands to execute. For example a batch command will need a longer
timeout than a non batch one. The command _command-timeout_ allows to
get, set and reset the command timeout.

[[retrieving-the-command-timeout]]
=== Retrieving the command timeout

The command _command-timeout get_ displays the current timeout in
seconds. A timeout of 0 means no timeout.

[source, java]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] command-timeout get
0
----

[[setting-the-command-timeout]]
=== Setting the command timeout

The command _command-timeout set_ update the timeout value to a number
of seconds. If a timeout has been set via configuration (XML file or
option), it is overridden by the _set_ action.

[source, java]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] command-timeout set 10
----

[[resetting-the-command-timeout]]
=== Resetting the command timeout

The command _command-timeout reset \{config|default}_ allows to set the
timeout to its configuration value (XML file or option) or default value
(0 second). If no configuration value is set, resetting to the
configuration value sets the timeout to its default value (0 seconds).

[source, java]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] command-timeout reset config
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] command-timeout reset default
----

[[default-native-management-interface-security]]
== Default Native Management Interface Security

The native interface shares the same security configuration as the http
interface, however we also support a local authentication mechanism
which means that the CLI can authenticate against the local WildFly
instance without prompting the user for a username and password. This
mechanism only works if the user running the CLI has read access to the
standalone/tmp/auth folder or domain/tmp/auth folder under the
respective WildFly installation - if the local mechanism fails then the
CLI will fallback to prompting for a username and password for a user
configured as in <<Default_HTTP_Interface_Security,Default HTTP Interface Security>>.

Establishing a CLI connection to a remote server will require a username
and password by default.

[[operation-requests]]
== Operation Requests

Operation requests allow for low level interaction with the management
model. They are different from the high level commands (i.e.
_create-jms-queue_) in that they allow you to read and modify the server
configuration as if you were editing the XML configuration files
directly. The configuration is represented as a tree of addressable
resources, where each node in the tree (aka resource) offers a set of
operations to execute.

An operation request basically consists of three parts: The _address_,
an _operation name_ and an optional set of _parameters_.

The formal specification for an operation request is:

....
[/node-type=node-name (/node-type=node-name)*] : operation-name [( [parameter-name=parameter-value (,parameter-name=parameter-value)*] )]
....

For example:

[source,ruby]
----
/subsystem=logging/root-logger=ROOT:change-root-log-level(level=WARN)
----

Tab Completion

[TIP]

Tab-completion is supported for all commands and options, i.e.
node-types and node-names, operation names and parameter names. We are
also considering adding aliases that are less verbose for the user, and
will translate into the corresponding operation requests in the
background.

Whitespaces between the separators in the operation request strings are
not significant.

[[addressing-resources]]
=== Addressing resources

Operation requests might not always have the address part or the
parameters. E.g.

[source,ruby]
----
:read-resource
----

which will list all the node types for the current node.

To syntactically disambiguate between the commands and operations,
operations require one of the following prefixes:

To execute an operation against the current node, e.g.

[source,ruby]
----
cd subsystem=logging
:read-resource(recursive="true")
----

To execute an operation against a child node of the current node, e.g.

[source,bash]
----
cd subsystem=logging
./root-logger=ROOT:change-root-log-level(level=WARN)
----

To execute an operation against the root node, e.g.

[source,ruby]
----
/:read-resource
----

[[available-operation-types-and-descriptions]]
=== Available Operation Types and Descriptions

The operation types can be distinguished between common operations that
exist on any node and specific operations that belong to a particular
configuration resource (i.e. subsystem). The common operations are:

* add
* read-attribute
* read-children-names
* read-children-resources
* read-children-types
* read-operation-description
* read-operation-names
* read-resource
* read-resource-description
* remove
* validate-address
* write-attribute

For a list of specific operations (e.g. operations that relate to the
logging subsystem) you can always query the model itself. For example,
to read the operations supported by the logging subsystem resource on a
standalone server:

[source,ruby]
----
[[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=logging:read-operation-names
{
   "outcome" => "success",
   "result" => [
       "add",
       "change-root-log-level",
       "read-attribute",
       "read-children-names",
       "read-children-resources",
       "read-children-types",
       "read-operation-description",
       "read-operation-names",
       "read-resource",
       "read-resource-description",
       "remove-root-logger",
       "root-logger-assign-handler",
       "root-logger-unassign-handler",
       "set-root-logger",
       "validate-address",
       "write-attribute"
   ]
}
----

As you can see, the logging resource offers four additional operations,
namely _root-logger-assign-handler_, _root-logger-unassign-handler_,
_set-root-logger_ and _remove-root-logger_.

Further documentation about a resource or operation can be retrieved
through the description:

[source,ruby]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=logging:read-operation-description(name=change-root-log-level)
{
   "outcome" => "success",
   "result" => {
       "operation-name" => "change-root-log-level",
       "description" => "Change the root logger level.",
       "request-properties" => {"level" => {
           "type" => STRING,
           "description" => "The log level specifying which message levels will be logged by this logger.
                            Message levels lower than this value will be discarded.",
           "required" => true
       }}
   }
}
----

Full model

[TIP]

To see the full model enter `:read-resource(recursive=true)`.

[[command-history]]
== Command History

Command (and operation request) history is enabled by default. The
history is kept both in-memory and in a file on the disk, i.e. it is
preserved between command line sessions. The history file name is
.jboss-cli-history and is automatically created in the user's home
directory. When the command line interface is launched this file is read
and the in-memory history is initialized with its content.

[TIP]

While in the command line session, you can use the arrow keys to go back
and forth in the history of commands and operations.

To manipulate the history you can use the _history_ command. If executed
without any arguments, it will print all the recorded commands and
operations (up to the configured maximum, which defaults to 500) from
the in-memory history.

_history_ supports three optional arguments:

* _disable_ - will disable history expansion (but will not clear the
previously recorded history);
* _enabled_ - will re-enable history expansion (starting from the last
recorded command before the history expansion was disabled);
* _clear_ - will clear the in-memory history (but not the file one).

[[batch-processing]]
== Batch Processing

The batch mode allows one to group commands and operations and execute
them together as an atomic unit. If at least one of the commands or
operations fails, all the other successfully executed commands and
operations in the batch are rolled back.

Not all of the commands are allowed in the batch. For example, commands
like _cd_, _ls_, _help_, etc. are not allowed in the batch since they
don't translate into operation requests. Only the commands that
translate into operation requests are allowed in the batch. The batch,
actually, is executed as a composite operation request.

The batch mode is entered by executing command _batch_.

[source,ruby]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] batch
[standalone@localhost:9990 / #] /subsystem=datasources/data-source="java\:\/H2DS":enable
[standalone@localhost:9990 / #] /subsystem=messaging-activemq/server=default/jms-queue=newQueue:add
----

You can execute a batch using the _run-batch_ command:

[source,ruby]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 / #] run-batch
The batch executed successfully.
----

Exit the batch edit mode without losing your changes:

[source,ruby]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 / #] holdback-batch
[standalone@localhost:9990 /]
----

Then activate it later on again:

[source,ruby]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] batch
Re-activated batch
#1 /subsystem=datasources/data-source=java:/H2DS:\/H2DS:enable
----

There are several other notable batch commands available as well (tab
complete to see the list):

* _clear-batch_
* _edit-batch-line_ (e.g. _edit-batch line 3 create-jms-topic
name=mytopic_)
* _remove-batch-line_ (e.g. _remove-batch-line 3_)
* _move-batch-line_ (e.g. _move-batch-line 3 1_)
* _discard-batch_
