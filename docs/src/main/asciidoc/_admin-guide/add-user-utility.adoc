= add-user utility
ifdef::env-github[:imagesdir: ../]

For use with the default configuration we supply a utility `add-user`
which can be used to manage the properties files for the default realms
used to store the users and their roles.

The add-user utility can be used to manage both the users in the
`ManagementRealm` and the users in the `ApplicationRealm`, changes made
apply to the properties file used both for domain mode and standalone
mode.

[TIP]

After you have installed your application server and decided if you are
going to run in standalone mode or domain mode you can delete the parent
folder for the mode you are not using, the add-user utility will then
only be managing the properties file for the mode in use.

The add-user utility is a command line utility however it can be run in
both interactive and non-interactive mode. Depending on your platform
the script to run the add-user utility is either `add-user.sh` or
`add-user.bat` which can be found in \{ `jboss.home}/bin`.

This guide now contains a couple of examples of this utility in use to
accomplish the most common tasks.

[[adding-a-user]]
== Adding a User

Adding users to the properties files is the primary purpose of this
utility. Usernames can only contain the following characters in any
number and in any order:

* Alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9)
* Dashes (-), periods (.), commas (,), at (@)
* Escaped backslash ( \\ )
* Escaped equals (\=)

[NOTE]

The server caches the contents of the properties files in memory,
however the server does check the modified time of the properties files
on each authentication request and re-load if the time has been updated
- this means all changes made by this utility are immediately applied to
any running server.

[[a-management-user]]
=== A Management User

[NOTE]

The default name of the realm for management users is `ManagementRealm`,
when the utility prompts for the realm name just accept the default
unless you have switched to a different realm.

[[interactive-mode]]
==== Interactive Mode

image:images/add-mgmt-user-interactive.png[Add mgmt user interactive]

Here we have added a new Management User called `adminUser`, as you can
see some of the questions offer default responses so you can just press
enter without repeating the default value.

For now just answer `n` or `no` to the final question, adding users to
be used by processes is described in more detail in the domain
management chapter.

[[add-user-non-interactive-mode]]
==== Non-Interactive Mode

To add a user in non-interactive mode the command
`./add-user.sh {username} {password`} can be used.

[WARNING]

If you add users using this approach there is a risk that any other user
that can view the list of running process may see the arguments
including the password of the user being added, there is also the risk
that the username / password combination will be cached in the history
file of the shell you are currently using.

[[an-application-user]]
=== An Application User

When adding application users in addition to adding the user with their
pre-hashed password it is also now possible to define the roles of the
user.

[[interactive-mode-1]]
==== Interactive Mode

image:images/add-app-user-interactive.png[add-app-user-interactive.png]

Here a new user called `appUser` has been added, in this case a comma
separated list of roles has also been specified.

As with adding a management user just answer `n` or `no` to the final
question until you know you are adding a user that will be establishing
a connection from one server to another.

[[non-interactive-mode-1]]
==== Non-Interactive Mode

To add an application user non-interactively use the command
`./add-user.sh -a {username} {password`}.

image:images/add-app-user-non-interactive.png[add-app-user-non-interactive.png]

[NOTE]

Non-interactive mode does not support defining a list of users, to
associate a user with a set of roles you will need to manually edit the
`application-roles.properties` file by hand.

[[updating-a-user]]
== Updating a User

Within the add-user utility it is also possible to update existing
users, in interactive mode you will be prompted to confirm if this is
your intention.

[[a-management-user-1]]
=== A Management User

[[interactive-mode-2]]
==== Interactive Mode

image:images/update-mgmt-user-interactive.png[update-mgmt-user-interactive.png]

[[non-interactive-mode-2]]
==== Non-Interactive Mode

In non-interactive mode if a user already exists the update is automatic
with no confirmation prompt.

[[an-application-user-1]]
=== An Application User

==== Interactive Mode

image:images/update-app-user-interactive.png[images/update-app-user-interactive.png]

[NOTE]

On updating a user with roles you will need to re-enter the list of
roles assigned to the user.

==== Non-Interactive Mode

In non-interactive mode if a user already exists the update is automatic
with no confirmation prompt.

[[community-contributions]]
== Community Contributions

There are still a few features to add to the add-user utility such as
removing users or adding application users with roles in non-interactive
mode, if you are interested in contributing to WildFly development the
add-user utility is a good place to start as it is a stand alone
utility, however it is a part of the AS build so you can become familiar
with the AS development processes without needing to delve straight into
the internals of the application server.
