= Starting & stopping Servers in a Managed Domain

Starting a standalone server is done through the `bin/standalone.sh`
script. However in a managed domain server instances are managed by the
domain controller and need to be started through the management layer:

First of all, get to know which `servers` are configured on a particular
`host`:

[source, ruby]
----
[domain@localhost:9990 /] :read-children-names(child-type=host)
{
   "outcome" => "success",
   "result" => ["local"]
}
 
 
[domain@localhost:9990 /] /host=local:read-children-names(child-type=server-config)
{
   "outcome" => "success",
   "result" => [
       "my-server",
       "server-one",
       "server-three"
   ]
}
----

Now that we know, that there are two `servers` configured on `host` "
_local_", we can go ahead and check their status:

[source, ruby]
----
[domain@localhost:9990 /] /host=local/server-config=server-one:read-resource(include-runtime=true)
{
   "outcome" => "success",
   "result" => {
       "auto-start" => true,
       "group" => "main-server-group",
       "interface" => undefined,
       "name" => "server-one",
       "path" => undefined,
       "socket-binding-group" => undefined,
       "socket-binding-port-offset" => undefined,
       "status" => "STARTED",
       "system-property" => undefined,
       "jvm" => {"default" => undefined}
   }
}
----

You can change the server state through the " _start_" and " _stop_"
operations

[source, ruby]
----
[domain@localhost:9990 /] /host=local/server-config=server-one:stop
{
   "outcome" => "success",
   "result" => "STOPPING"
}
----

[TIP]

Navigating through the domain topology is much more simple when you use
the web interface.
