= Suspend, Resume and Graceful shutdown

[[core-concepts]]
== Core Concepts

Wildfly introduces the ability to suspend and resume servers. This can
be combined with shutdown to enable the server to gracefully finish
processing all active requests and then shut down. When a server is
suspended it will immediately stop accepting new requests, but wait for
existing request to complete. A suspended server can be resumed at any
point, and will begin processing requests immediately. Suspending and
resuming has no effect on deployment state (e.g. if a server is
suspended singleton EJB's will not be destroyed). As of Wildfly 11 it is
also possible to start a server in suspended mode which means it will
not accept requests until it has been resumed, servers will also be
suspended during the boot process, so no requests will be accepted until
the startup process is 100% complete.

Suspend/Resume has no effect on management operations, management
operations can still be performed while a server is suspended. If you
wish to perform a management operation that will affect the operation of
the server (e.g. changing a datasource) you can suspend the server,
perform the operation, then resume the server. This allows all requests
to finish, and makes sure that no requests are running while the
management changes are taking place.

When a server is suspending it goes through four different phases:

* *RUNNING* - The normal state, the server is accepting requests and
running normally
* *PRE_SUSPEND* - In PRE_SUSPEND the server will notify external parties
that it is about to suspend, for example mod_cluster will notify the
load balancer that the deployment is suspending. Requests are still
accepted in this phase.
* *SUSPENDING* - All new requests are rejected, and the server is
waiting for all active requests to finish. If there are no active
requests at suspend time this phase will be skipped.
* *SUSPENDED* - All requests have completed, and the server is
suspended.

[[starting-suspended]]
== Starting Suspended

In order to start into suspended mode when using a standalone server you
need to add *--start-mode=suspend* to the command line. It is also
possible to specify the start-mode in the *reload* operation to cause
the server to reload into suspended mode (other possible values for
start-mode are *normal* and *admin-only*).

In domain mode servers can be started in suspended mode by passing the
*suspend=true* parameter to any command that causes a server to start,
restart or reload (e.g. :start-servers(suspend=true)).

[[the-request-controller-subsystem]]
== The Request Controller Subsystem

Wildfly introduces a new subsystem called the Request Controller
Subsystem. This optional subsystem tracks all requests at their entry
point, which how the graceful shutdown mechanism know when all requests
are done (it also allows you to provide a global limit on the total
number of running requests).

If this subsystem is not present suspend/resume will be limited, in
general things that happen in the PRE_SUSPEND phase will work as normal
(stopping message delivery, notifying the load balancer), however the
server will not wait for all requests to complete and instead move
straight to SUSPENDED mode.

There is a small performance penalty associated with the request
controller subsystem (about on par with enabling statistics), so if you
do not require the suspend/resume functionality this subsystem can be
removed to get a small performance boost.

[[subsystem-integrations]]
== Subsystem Integrations

Suspend/Resume is a service provided by the Wildfly platform that any
subsystem may choose to integrate with. Some subsystems integrate
directly with the suspend controller, while others integrate through the
request controller subsystem.

The following subsystems support graceful shutdown. Note that only
subsystems that provide an external entry point to the server need
graceful shutdown support, for example the JAX-RS subsystem does not
require suspend/resume support as all access to JAX-RS is through the
web connector.

* *Undertow* - Undertow will wait for all requests to finish
* *mod_cluster* - The mod_cluster subsystem will notify the load
balancer that the server is suspending in the PRE_SUSPEND phase.
* *EJB* - EJB will wait for all remote EJB requests and MDB message
deliveries to finish. Delivery to MDB's is stopped in the PRE_SUSPEND
phase. EJB timers are suspended, and missed timers will be activated
when the server is resumed.
* *Batch* - Batch jobs will be stopped at a checkpoint while the server
is suspending. They will be restarted from that checkpoint when the
server returns to running mode.
* *EE Concurrency* - The server will wait for all active jobs to finish.
All jobs that have already been queued will be skipped.
* *Transactions* - transaction subsystem waits for all running
transactions to finish while server is suspending. During that time
server refuses to start any new transaction. But any in-flight
transaction will be serviced - e.g. it means that server accepts any
incoming remote call which carries context of the transaction already
started at the suspending server. +
When you work with EJBs you have to enable the graceful shutdown
functionality by setting attribute `enable-graceful-txn-shutdown` to
`true`. +
(at the `ejb3 subsystem` xml, for example): +
`<enable-graceful-txn-shutdown value="false"/>` +
By *default* graceful shutdown it's *disabled* for ejb subsystem. +
The reason is that the behavior might be unwelcome in cluster
environments, as the server notifies remote clients that the node is no
longer available for remote calls only after the transactions are
finished. During that brief window of time, the client of a cluster may
send a new request to a node that is shutting down and will refuse the
request because it is not related to an existing transaction. +
If this attribute `enable-graceful-txn-shutdown` is set to `false`, we
disable the graceful behavior and EJB clients will not attempt to invoke
the node when it suspends, regardless of active transactions.

[[standalone-mode]]
== Standalone Mode

Suspend/Resume can be controlled via the following CLI operations in
standalone mode:

`:suspend(timeout=z)`

Suspends the server. If the timeout is specified it will wait up to the
specified number of seconds for all requests to finish. If there is no
timeout specified or the value is less than zero it will wait
indefinitely.

`:resume`

Resumes a previously suspended server. The server should be able to
begin serving requests immediately.

`:read-attribute(name=suspend-state)`

Returns the current suspend state of the server.

`:shutdown(timeout=x)`

If a timeout parameter is passed to the shutdown command then a graceful
shutdown will be performed. The server will be suspended, and will wait
up to the specified number of seconds for all requests to finish before
shutting down. A timeout value of less than zero means it will wait
indefinitely.

[[domain-mode]]
== Domain Mode

Domain mode has similar commands as standalone mode, however they can be
applied at both the global and server group levels:

*Whole Domain*

`:suspend-servers(timeout=x)`

:resume-servers

:stop-servers(timeout=x)

*Server Group*

`/server-group=main-server-group:suspend-servers(timeout=x)`

`/server-group=main-server-group:resume-servers`

`/server-group=main-server-group:stop-servers(timeout=x)`

*Server*

`/host=master/server-config=server-one:suspend(timeout=x)`

/host=master/server-config=server-one:resume

/host=master/server-config=server-one:stop(timeout=x)
