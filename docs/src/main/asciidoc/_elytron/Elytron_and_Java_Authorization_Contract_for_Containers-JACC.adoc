== Overview

This document will guide you on how to enable JACC using Elytron
Subsystem.

[[disabling-jacc-in-legacy-security-subsystem-picketbox]]
== Disabling JACC in Legacy Security Subsystem (PicketBox)

By default, the application server uses the legacy security subsystem
(PicketBox) to configure the JACC policy provider and factory. The
default configuration maps to implementations from PicketBox.

In order to use Elytron to manage JACC configuration (or any other
policy you want to install to the application server) you must first
disable JACC in legacy security subsystem. For that, please execute the
following CLI command:

[source, ruby]
----
/subsystem=security:write-attribute(name=initialize-jacc, value=false)
----

The command above tells the legacy security subsystem to not initialize
any JACC related configuration, but rely on the policies defined via
Elytron subsystem as we'll see in the next sections.

[[defining-a-jacc-policy-provider]]
== Defining a JACC Policy Provider

Elytron subsystem provides a built-in policy provider based on JACC
specification. To create the policy provider you can execute a CLI
command as follows:

[source, ruby]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=elytron/policy=jacc:add(jacc-policy={})
----

After executing the command above, please reload the server
configuration as follows:

[source, ruby]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] reload
----

[[enabling-jacc-to-a-web-deployment]]
== Enabling JACC to a Web Deployment

Once JACC Policy Provider is defined you can enable JACC to web
deployments by executing the following command:

[source, ruby]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=undertow/application-security-domain=other:add(http-authentication-factory=application-http-authentication,enable-jacc=true)
----

The command above defines a default security domain for applications if
none is provided in *jboss-web.xml.* In case you already have a
*application-security-domain* defined and just want to enable JACC you
can execute a command as follows:

[source, ruby]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=undertow/application-security-domain=my-security-domain:write-attribute(name=enable-jacc,value=true)
----

[[enabling-jacc-to-a-ejb-deployment]]
== Enabling JACC to a EJB Deployment

Once JACC Policy Provider is defined you can enable JACC to EJB
deployments by executing the following command:

[source, ruby]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=ejb3/application-security-domain=other:add(security-domain=ApplicationDomain,enable-jacc=true)
----

The command above defines a default security domain for EJBs. In case
you already have a *application-security-domain *defined and just want
to enable JACC you can execute a command as follows:

[source, ruby]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=ejb3/application-security-domain=my-security-domain:write-attribute(name=enable-jacc,value=true)
----
