[[Elytron_Subsystem]]
= Elytron Subsystem

WildFly Elytron is a security framework used to unify security across
the entire application server. The _elytron_ subsystem enables a single
point of configuration for securing both applications and the management
interfaces. WildFly Elytron also provides a set of APIs and SPIs for
providing custom implementations of functionality and integrating with
the _elytron_ subsystem.

In addition, there are several other important features of the WildFly
Elytron:

* Stronger authentication mechanisms for HTTP and SASL authentication.
* Improved architecture that allows for _SecurityIdentities_ to be
propagated across security domains and transparently transformed ready
to be used for authorization. This transformation takes place using
configurable role decoders, role mappers, and permission mappers.
* Centralized point for SSL/TLS configuration including cipher suites
and protocols.
* SSL/TLS optimizations such as eager _SecureIdentity_ construction and
closely tying authorization to establishing an SSL/TLS connection. Eager
_SecureIdentity_ construction eliminates the need for a _SecureIdentity_
to be constructed on a per-request basis. Closely tying authentication
to establishing an SSL/TLS connection enables permission checks to
happen _BEFORE_ the first request is received.
* A secure credential store that replaces the previous vault
implementation to store clear text credentials.

The new _elytron_ subsystem exists in parallel to the legacy _security_
subsystem and legacy core management authentication. Both the legacy and
Elytron methods may be used for securing the management interfaces as
well as providing security for applications.

[[out-of-the-box-configuration]]
== Out of the Box Configuration

WildFly provides a set of components configured by default. While these
components are ready to use, the legacy _security_ subsystem and legacy
core management authentication is still used by default. To configure
WildFly to use the these configured components as well as create new
ones, see the <<Using_the_Elytron_Subsystem,Using the Elytron
Subsystem>> section.

[cols=",",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|Default Component |Description

|ApplicationDomain |The ApplicationDomain security domain uses
ApplicationRealm and groups-to-roles for authentication. It also uses
default-permission-mapper to assign the login permission.

|ManagementDomain |The ManagementDomain security domain uses two
security realms for authentication: ManagementRealm with groups-to-roles
and local with super-user-mapper. It also uses default-permission-mapper
to assign the login permission.

|local (security realm) |The local security realm does no authentication
and sets the identity of principals to $local

|ApplicationRealm |The ApplicationRealm security realm is a properties
realm that authenticates principals using application-users.properties
and assigns roles using application-roles.properties. These files are
located under jboss.server.config.dir, which by default, maps to
EAP_HOME/standalone/configuration. They are also the same files used by
the legacy security default configuration.

|ManagementRealm |The ManagementRealm security realm is a properties
realm that authenticates principals using mgmt-users.properties and
assigns roles using mgmt-groups.properties. These files are located
under jboss.server.config.dir, which by default, maps to
EAP_HOME/standalone/configuration. They are also the same files used by
the legacy security default configuration.

|default-permission-mapper |The default-permission-mapper mapper is a
simple permission mapper that uses the default-permissions permission set
to assign the full set of permissions that an identity would require to
access any services on the server. For example, the default-permission-mapper
mapper uses org.wildfly.extension.batch.jberet.deployment.BatchPermission
specified by the default-permissions permission set to assign permission for
batch jobs. The batch permissions are start, stop, restart, abandon, and read
which aligns with javax.batch.operations.JobOperator. The default-permission-mapper
mapper also uses org.wildfly.security.auth.permission.LoginPermission specified
by the the login-permission permission set to assign the login permission.

|local (mapper) |The local mapper is a constant role mapper that maps to
the local security realm. This is used to map authentication to the
local security realm.

|groups-to-roles |The groups-to-roles mapper is a simple-role-decoder
that will decode the groups information of a principal and use it for
the role information.

|super-user-mapper |The super-user-mapper mapper is a constant role
mapper that maps the SuperUser role to a principal.

|management-http-authentication |The management-http-authentication
http-authentication-factory can be used for doing authentication over
http. It uses the global provider-http-server-mechanism-factory to
filter authentication mechanism and uses ManagementDomain for
authenticating principals. It accepts the DIGEST authentication
mechanisms and exposes it as ManagementRealm to applications.

|global (provider-http-server-mechanism-factory) |This is the HTTP
server factory mechanism definition used to list the provided
authentication mechanisms when creating an http authentication factory.

|management-sasl-authentication |The management-sasl-authentication
sasl-authentication-factory can be used for authentication using SASL.
It uses the configured sasl-server-factory to filter authentication
mechanisms, which also uses the global provider-sasl-server-factory to
filter by provider names. management-sasl-authentication uses the
ManagementDomain security domain for authentication of principals. It
also maps authentication using JBOSS-LOCAL-USER mechanisms using the
local realm mapper and authentication using DIGEST-MD5 to
ManagementRealm.

|application-sasl-authentication |The application-sasl-authentication
sasl-authentication-factory can be used for authentication using SASL.
It uses the configured sasl-server-factory to filter authentication
mechanisms, which also uses the global provider-sasl-server-factory to
filter by provider names. application-sasl-authentication uses the
ApplicationDomain security domain for authentication of principals.

|global (provider-sasl-server-factory) |This is the SASL server factory
definition used to create SASL authentication factories.

|elytron (mechanism-provider-filtering-sasl-server-factor) |This is used
to filter which sasl-authentication-factory is used based on the
provider. In this case, elytron will match on the WildFlyElytron
provider name.

|configured (configurable-sasl-server-factory) |This is used to filter
sasl-authentication-factory is used based on the mechanism name. In this
case, configured will match on JBOSS-LOCAL-USER and DIGEST-MD5. It also
sets the wildfly.sasl.local-user.default-user to $local.

|combined-providers |Is an aggregate provider that aggreates the elytron
and openssl provider loaders.

|elytron |A provider loader

|openssl |A provider loader

[[default-application-authentication-configuration]]
== Default Application Authentication Configuration

By default, applications are secured using legacy security domains.
Applications must specify a security domain in their _web.xml_ as well
as the authentication method. If no security domain is specified by the
application, WildFly will use the provided _other_ legacy security
domain.
