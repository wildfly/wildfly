link:#Galleon_Provisioning[Galleon provisioning], link:#WildFly_Maven_Plugin_Provisioning[WildFly Maven Plugin] or link:#Bootable_JAR[bootable JAR], this guide helps you identify the 
installation strategy that best fits your application requirements.

= WildFly or WildFly Preview

The WildFly project now produces two appserver variants, link:WildFly_and_WildFly_Preview{outfilesuffix}[standard WildFly and WildFly Preview],
so you'll want to decide which is right for you. For most users the standard WildFly variant is the right choice,
but if you'd like a technical preview look at what's coming in the future, try out WildFly Preview.

[[Zipped_Installation]]
= Installing WildFly from a zipped distribution

http://www.wildfly.org/downloads[Downloading the WildFly release zip] and unzipping it is the traditional way to install
a complete WildFly server with support for both standalone and managed domain operating modes. A WildFly distribution
contains a large number of default configurations allowing you to select the server features and operating modes.

A WildFly distribution based installation is well suited when:

* You want to rely on a traditional Jakarta EE application deployment.
* You want a Jakarta EE or MicroProfile platform compliant server that offers all Jakarta EE or MicroProfile features.
* You are not (yet) concerned by server installation size and memory footprint.
* You are not yet sure of the kind of operating mode and application you are targeting.
* Your server instances will contain one or more application deployments.

If that is the kind of installation you are aiming at, the guides that you should read next are:

* The link:Getting_Started_Guide{outfilesuffix}[Getting Started Guide] shows you
how to install, start and configure the server.
* The link:Getting_Started_Developing_Applications_Guide{outfilesuffix}[Getting
Started Developing Applications Guide] shows you how to build Jakarta EE
applications and deploy them to WildFly.

[[Galleon_Provisioning]]
= Installing WildFly with Galleon

Galleon provisioning tooling allows you to construct a customized WildFly installation according to your application needs. 
Some applications don't need a fully featured server supporting all operating modes and containing all Jakarta EE capabilities. 
Galleon tooling allows you to select the server capabilities you want to see installed. 

A WildFly server provisioned with Galleon is well suited when:

* You want to rely on a traditional Jakarta EE application deployment.
* You want to easily update an installation to the latest WildFly version.
* Your application requires only a subset of the Jakarta EE or MicroProfile platform APIs
(although Galleon can provision a server that supports the full set of Jakarta EE and MicroProfile platform APIs).
* You are concerned by server installation size and memory footprint.
* You are only using standalone operating mode (with support for High Availability or not).
* Your server instances will contain one or more application deployments.

If that is the kind of installation you are aiming at, the guides that you should read next are:

* The link:Galleon_Guide{outfilesuffix}[Galleon Provisioning Guide] shows you how to
provision customized WildFly server using Galleon.
* The link:Getting_Started_Developing_Applications_Guide{outfilesuffix}[Getting
Started Developing Applications Guide] shows you how to build Jakarta EE
applications and deploy them to WildFly.

[[WildFly_Maven_Plugin_Provisioning]]
= Installing WildFly with the WildFly Maven Plugin

The link:https://docs.wildfly.org/wildfly-maven-plugin[WildFly Maven Plugin] exposes a `package` goal that allows you 
to provision a customized WildFly installation containing your application.

Using the WildFly Maven Plugin is well suited when:

* You are building your application using Maven.
* Your application requires only a subset of the Jakarta EE or MicroProfile platform APIs
(although the WildFly Maven Plugin can provision a server that supports the full set of Jakarta EE and MicroProfile platform APIs).
* You are concerned by server installation size and memory footprint.
* You are only using standalone operating mode (with support for High Availability or not).
* Your server instances will contain one or more application deployments.
* You are using WildFly link:https://docs.wildfly.org/wildfly-charts/[Helm Charts] to deploy your application on the cloud.

If that is the kind of installation you are aiming at, the guide that you should read next is:

* The link:WildFly_Maven_Plugin_Guide{outfilesuffix}[WildFly Maven Plugin Guide] 
shows you how to configure a Maven `pom.xml` file to provision a customized WildFly server containing your application.

[[Bootable_JAR]]
= WildFly Bootable JAR

A bootable JAR contains both a customized WildFly server and your deployment. Such a JAR can
then run with a simple java command such as ``java -jar myapp-bootable.jar``

A bootable JAR is built using Maven. You need to integrate the  
link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-maven-plugin[WildFly Maven plugin] 
in the Maven project of your application.

[NOTE]
The ability to build a WildFly Bootable JAR has been added to the link:https://docs.wildfly.org/wildfly-maven-plugin[WildFly Maven Plugin].  
The use of the link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin[WildFly Bootable JAR Maven plugin] has been deprecated. 

A Bootable JAR is well suited when:

* You want to leverage your existing WildFly applications.
* You want to build a microservice composed of a server and a single application deployment.
* You are concerned by JAR size and memory footprint.
* You are only using standalone operating mode (with support for High Availability or not).
* You are building your application using Maven.

If that is the kind of installation you are aiming at, the guides that you should read next are:

* The link:WildFly_Maven_Plugin_Guide{outfilesuffix}[WildFly Maven Plugin Guide] 
shows you how to configure a Maven `pom.xml` file to provision a customized WildFly server containing your application.
* The link:Bootable_Guide{outfilesuffix}[Bootable JAR Guide] shows you how to package your application and the WildFly server
into a bootable JAR.
