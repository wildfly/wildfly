[role="_abstract"]
You can use the source-to-image (S2I) workflow to deploy your applications to {ProductShortname} on {cloudPlatform}. The S2I workflow takes source code from a Git repository and injects it into a container that's based on the language and framework you want to use. After the S2I workflow is completed, the `src` code is compiled, the application is packaged and is deployed to the {ProductShortName} server.
