== Overview

The `docs` module is not in the module listing of the parent POM by default. Therefore to build you must either activate
the docs profile or be in the `docs` directory to build the documentation. This documentation assumes you're in the
`docs` directory.

You can activate the docs profile from the root directory with either `-Pdocs` or `-Ddocs=true`.


== Configuring the POM

In the POM there are currently 3 main properties:

1. `appservername`
2. `oracle-javadoc`
3. `wildflyversion`

Currently the only property that may need to be changed is the `wildflyversion` property. This defaults to the property
`product.docs.server.version` which can be found in the parent POM. It already should be set to the current major
version, but should likely be checked.


== Building the documentation

Building the documentation can be done with the following command:

.Generate Only
```
mvn clean package
```

.Generate and Copy
```
mvn clean package -Pcopy-site
```

The `asciidoctor-maven-plugin` will execute and generate html5 files. The files are generated in the
`target/generated-docs` directory. You can optionally activate the `copy-site` profile to copy the generated site. See
<<copy-site-profile,copy site option 2>> for more details


== Adding the documentation to docs.wildfly.org

=== Clone `wildfly.github.io` Repository

The first thing required here is a clone of the https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly.github.io repository. Once cloned
it's likely best to checkout a new branch for to update the documentation.

=== Copy Site

Copying the site can be done one of two ways:

1. You can manually copy the `target/generated-site` from the `docs` directory of WildFly over to the
   `wildfly.github.io` repository. This should be copied into a version directory. For example `16` for WildFly 16.

2. [[copy-site-profile]]You can run the build with `mvn clean package -Pcopy-site` which by default attempts to copy the site to
   `../../wildfly.github.io/${product.docs.server.version}`. This can be overridden with the `wildfly.github.io.dir`
   property.

=== Add Copied Content

Once copied you'll need to add the directory to the git repository; `git add ./16` for example.

=== Edit and Build Index

Next in the `wildfly.github.io` repository you'll need to edit the `index.adoc` and add the newly created directory. We
try to keep the listings in release order with the new release on top.

Once you edit the `index.adoc` you'll need to regenerate the `index.html` file. This can be done with the `asciidoctor`
command.

```
asciidoctor index.adoc
```

After all that is complete you can commit your changes and submit a PR.
